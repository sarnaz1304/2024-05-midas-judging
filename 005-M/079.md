# M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE can't burn mTBILL tokens if the user is blacklisted.

## Summary

Modified hook ```_beforeTokenTransfer``` prevents M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE from burning the token if user is blacklisted.

## Vulnerability Detail
 ```_beforeTokenTransfer``` function in mTBILL.sol is modified by putting ```onlyNotBlacklisted(from)``` , ```onlyNotBlacklisted(to)``` modifiers and overriding the ERC20PausableUpgradeable's ```_beforeTokenTransfer```  function. 

The hook ```_beforeTokenTransfer``` is called before any transfer of tokens, and also includes minting and burning. This function is deprecated in Openzeppelin's version 5.0 and above (mTBILL.sol  uses 4.9.0).

Therefore, when M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE calls ``` burn(address from, uint256 amount)```, internal function ```_burn``` will call 
```_beforeTokenTransfer``` function in mTBILL.sol. If the ```from``` address is blacklisted, this call will revert. 


## Impact
Protocol can't burn blacklisted user's tokens and those amounts stay as part of total supply unless the user is removed from the blacklist.

## Recommendation

Add a condition to the onlyNotBlacklisted modifier so that when msg.sender is M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE, it can bypass it.
