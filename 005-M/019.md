# A blacklisted mTBill token cannot be burnt

## Summary
If an address is put on blacklist after previously minted some mTBill tokens, the admin cannot burn his tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The [`_beforeTokenTransfer`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mTBILL.sol#L90) function is called whenever a transfer is initiated. Burning a token is essentically transferring the ownership to the zero address, and `_beforeTokenTransfer` will be called, too.

```solidity
    function _burn(address account, uint256 amount) internal virtual {
        require(account != address(0), "ERC20: burn from the zero address");

        _beforeTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);

        uint256 accountBalance = _balances[account];
        require(accountBalance >= amount, "ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance");
        unchecked {
            _balances[account] = accountBalance - amount;
        }
        _totalSupply -= amount;

        emit Transfer(account, address(0), amount);

        _afterTokenTransfer(account, address(0), amount);
    }
```

In `mTBILL._beforeTokenTransfer`, we see blacklisted users are checked and prohibited:

```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable)
        onlyNotBlacklisted(from)
        onlyNotBlacklisted(to)
    {
        ERC20PausableUpgradeable._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

Which then calls super class's function. The modifier checks if an address is in the blacklist, if so, return false and revert. When an address is put on the blacklist, and in the case or minting or burning, which is essentially transferring token from zero address or to zero address, will have `from` and `to` address set to this blacklisted user, and will fail due to revert. An admin can certainly put the user out of blacklist, but it means this user can also exploit this and frontrun the burn call to redeem  or do other operations.

## Impact
A blacklisted user's mTBILL tokens cannot be burnt, and if an admin tries to unban it, this user can frontrun and do redeem instead.

## Code Snippet
```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable)
        onlyNotBlacklisted(from)
        onlyNotBlacklisted(to)
    {
        ERC20PausableUpgradeable._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a `burnOrMint` parameter to the modifier, and makes the modifier to return true when trying to burn or mint depends on the actual situation.
