# Admin can not burn tokens from blacklisted addresses.

## Summary
The `mTBILL` smart contract is `ERC20PausableUpgradeable`. There is an override internal function `_beforeTokenTransfer` which will check if  `from` and `to` are blacklisted and if so, the transaction will revert. However these checks will be performed upon `mint` and `burn`. This means that the admin will not be able to burn blacklisted users tokens and they will remain stuck.

## Vulnerability Detail
As mentioned above, `mTBILL` is `ERC20PausableUpgradeable`. The functions `transfer`, `transferFrom`, `mint` and `burn` have hooks `_beforeTokenTransfer` and `_afterTokenTransfer`. The `_beforeTokenTransfer` is overriden and looks like this:

```solidity
    /**
     * @dev overrides _beforeTokenTransfer function to ban
     * blaclisted users from using the token functions
     */
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable)
        onlyNotBlacklisted(from)
        onlyNotBlacklisted(to)
    {
        ERC20PausableUpgradeable._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

The modifier `onlyNotBlacklisted` will check if the address passed as parameter is blacklisted and revert if that is true. However for burning, this should not be the case. The tokens will remain lock and even so, if the admin removes the blacklisted role and then burns tokens, the user can frontrun the burn transaction and move away his tokens.

The protocol team even added a [test case](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/a4a3cc23bb891913ce44665a4cdea9f5c1190f6c/midas-contracts/test/mTBILL.test.ts#L191C1-L204C8) that proves `burn` will fail on blacklisted addresses:

```jsx
    it('should fail: burn(...) when address is blacklisted', async () => {
      const { owner, mTBILL, regularAccounts, accessControl } =
        await loadFixture(defaultDeploy);
      const blacklisted = regularAccounts[0];

      await mint({ mTBILL, owner }, blacklisted, 1);
      await blackList(
        { blacklistable: mTBILL, accessControl, owner },
        blacklisted,
      );
      await burn({ mTBILL, owner }, blacklisted, 1, {
        revertMessage: acErrors.WMAC_HAS_ROLE,
      });
    });
```

```solidity
  mTBILL
    _beforeTokenTransfer()
      ✓ should fail: burn(...) when address is blacklisted
```

## Impact
Tokens stuck in blacklisted addresses and risk of blacklisted users transferring tokens by inserting transaction between revoke of blacklist role and burn of tokens.

## Proof of Concept
A coded PoC that shows how a blacklisted user can rescue his tokens:

```jsx
  it.only('unblacklisted transfers before burn', async () => {
    const { mTBILL, owner, regularAccounts, accessControl, blackListableTester } = await loadFixture(
      defaultDeploy,
    );

    // Alice will have 100e18 mTBill tokens
    const amount = parseUnits('100');
    const alice = regularAccounts[0];
    const aliceNew = regularAccounts[1];
    await mint({ mTBILL, owner }, alice, amount);

    const initialBalance = await mTBILL.balanceOf(alice.address);
    console.log("Initial balance: " + initialBalance);

    // Alice is blacklisted
    await blackList(
      { blacklistable: blackListableTester, accessControl, owner },
      alice,
    );

    // Alice's tokens are stuck and can not be transfered nor burned
    await expect(mTBILL.connect(alice).transfer(aliceNew.address, amount)).revertedWith(acErrors.WMAC_HAS_ROLE);
    await expect(mTBILL.connect(owner).burn(alice.address, amount)).revertedWith(acErrors.WMAC_HAS_ROLE);

    await unBlackList(
      { blacklistable: blackListableTester, accessControl, owner },
      alice,
    );

    // Alice sees tx that she will be removed from blacklist because burner wants to burn her tokens, so she frontruns tx and transfer to other address of hers
    await mTBILL.connect(alice).transfer(aliceNew.address, amount);

    const aliceOldAddressBalance = await mTBILL.balanceOf(alice.address);
    const aliceNewAddressBalance = await mTBILL.balanceOf(aliceNew.address);

    console.log("Alice old address balance: " + aliceOldAddressBalance);
    console.log("Alice new address balance: " + aliceNewAddressBalance);

    // Burner's burn tx will fail as Alice balance is 0
    await burn({ mTBILL, owner }, alice, amount, {
      revertMessage: 'ERC20: burn amount exceeds balance',
    });
  })
```

```solidity
  Blacklistable
Initial balance: 100000000000000000000
Alice old address balance: 0
Alice new address balance: 100000000000000000000
    ✓ unblacklisted transfers before burn
```

## Tool used
Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
My suggestion will be the following: do not call `_burn()` inside `burn()`, because that is where `_beforeTokenTransfer()` is called, instead copy all the logic from `_burn()` inside `burn()` without `_beforeTokenTransfer` hook.
