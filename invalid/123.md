# Some users may pay `minAmountToDepositInEuro` when they should be exempt from minimum deposit

## Summary
Based on the conversation with the Midas team the users are required to pay `minAmountToDepositInEuro` (which is 100,000 euros at this time) for the first time when they deposit and after that they should be exempt from the minimum required amount. (which is set by the admin manually)
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies with that there is not tracking if users are already made deposit or not , and they are updated manually (which can lead to a mistake)
PoC:
Imagine user deposited once and they deposited minimum required amount (as they should), but now they want to deposit again. The amount they want to deposit can be lower than minimum required because they should be exempt from the minimum requirement to deposit since they already deposited minimum of 100,000 euros. Since there is no mapping of users who already deposited required minimum amount (usually first time depositors) the admin could not see that from the protocol and may miss including the same user in `isFreeFromMinDeposit` mapping which will make them pay minimum amount required when they should not.
## Impact
The users will be forced to over deposit and overpay when they should not.

```javascript
    function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is to have a mapping of first time depositor users (or users who already deposited) so protocol know if someone has been deposited before or not and to have a check for that so the admin know that they should be exempt from minimum required amount.
