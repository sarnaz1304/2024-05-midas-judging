# Unsafe accounting threatens to break the mTBILL token peg to the IB01 price

## Summary

In the [Midas docs](https://docs.midas.app/protocol-mechanics/mtbill-token) it is said that:

>1:1 Tracking: Each mTBILL token represents one share of the BlackRock Treasury Bond ([fund](https://www.blackrock.com/uk/individual/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf)) and is fully redeemable for the net asset value ([NAV](https://docs.midas.app/additional-topics/glossary#net-asset-value-nav)) of its representative amount.

Unsafe accounting in both the `DepositVault` and the `RedemptionVault` may break that promise and in case of a "bank-run" from users, its extremely possible someone will lose money.

This issue could potentially be very serious since the protocol is [regulated by the law](https://docs.midas.app/protocol-mechanics/legal-and-compliance/regulatory-compliance) and users who lose money due to the 1:1 not being true, could very easily use legal forces against the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

The issue arises from the fact that a user has the ability to `deposit` or `redeem` fractional shares but the protocol team can only buy or sell the IB01 in full shares off-chain. In the [IB01 ETF](https://www.blackrock.com/uk/individual/products/307243/ishares-treasury-bond-0-1yr-ucits-etf)'s official page (which is also linked in the Midas docs above) there is a [Prospectus pdf page](https://www.blackrock.com/uk/literature/prospectus/ishares-plc-prospectus-en.pdf) file, under article `(b) Title to Shares` it clearly states:

>(b) Title to Shares
....... **_Fractional Shares will not be issued._** .......

This is also confirmed with the protocol team through discord:

>A share costs $110.50. If you are asking to redeem half of a share, we would sell one entirely, and then keep $50 on the balance sheet not being $IB01.

This means that the protocol will almost always hold some value in USD which will not move with the IB01's price movements (which averages daily increases in price). This means in the long run or even in the short term if the protocol doesn't have a lot of users, the protocol faces the danger to not be able to fully back all the shares it has minted to the users.

**It's important to remember that historical price movements != future price movements. We want to cover all cases and make sure that the peg is safe at extreme price volatilities too.**

## Impact

Potential breakage of the 1:1 peg between the `mTBILL` token and the IB01. The protocol cant assure the peg due to having some balance in USD dollars which doesn't follow price fluctuations of the real shares. This is a broken peg, plus long run, the more price fluctuates of shares the bigger the loss will be for someone due to the intrinsically broken peg.

## Proof of Concept

Let's see the following scenario. Let's say 1 IB01 share = $100.

1. Bob deposits for 2.1 mTBILL tokens.
2. Protocol buys 3 IB01 shares and mints Bob 2.1 mTBILL tokens.
3. Alice deposits for 0.85 mTBILL tokens.
4. Protocol already has 0.9 IB01 shares remaining so they just mint Alice 0.85 mTBILL tokens.
5. Bob redeems all his 2.1 mTBILL tokens.
6. Protocol shares all 3 IB01 shares and pays Bob $210. Protocol has $90 left.
7. IB01 price goes to $110.
8. Alice redeems her 0.85 mTBILL tokens.
9. 0.85 * $110 = $93.5. Protocol has only $90 left and can't cover Alice's full withdrawal.

I know these numbers are very small compared to what the protocol will hold, but they are here to prove my point. Even if protocol loses 0.01% of the peg per year, in the long run it will be a big amount and **the legal impact will be huge and serious.**

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Rethink the `deposit` and `redeem` functions in `DepositVault.sol` and `RedemptionVault.sol`. 
Possibly use the IB01/USD data feed to only allow deposits and redeems of full shares.
The point is not to allow minting and redemptions of fractional shares, only full shares. You can calculate off-chain the full shares in every `deposit` and `redeem` and implement a refund function to send back the remaining money.
