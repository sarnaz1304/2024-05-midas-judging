# The `addPaymentToken` function allows adding duplicate token addresses to the `_paymentTokens`

## Summary
The `addPaymentToken` function allows adding duplicate token addresses to the `_paymentTokens`

## Vulnerability Detail
The `require` statement in the `addPaymentToken` function checks if the `add` operation on the `_paymentTokens` set was successful. However, it does not explicitly check if the token address already exists in the set before attempting to add it.

## Impact
if the `add` operation succeeds despite the token address already being present in the set, duplicate token addresses can be added to the `_paymentTokens` set. This can lead to unintended behavior and data inconsistencies. Even when a token address is removed for a particular reason, if there are duplicates, the removed token address would still be in the set.


## Code Snippet
`  require(_paymentTokens.add(token), "MV: already added");`
