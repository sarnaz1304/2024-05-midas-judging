# Lack of access control over off-chain withdrawals

## Summary
Any user can redeem with off-chain USD bank transfer without authorization.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `RedemptionVault::redeem()` function allows users to redeem tokens through an off-chain USD bank transfer by providing a zero address for the `tokenOut` parameter. This mechanism transfers the user's mTBILL tokens to the contract and initiates an off-chain USD transfer.

However, off-chain USD bank transfers require proper handling of bank account information. If the `RedemptionVault::redeem()` function is called with a zero address for `tokenOut` without ensuring the correct off-chain procedures are followed, it can lead to situations where mTBILL tokens are transferred, but the USD bank transfer fails due to missing bank account details.

## Impact
Potential USD bank transfer failure.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Introduce a new `redeemOffChain()` function that requires a valid signature from an authorized signer, ensuring that only verified and authorized requests are processed.

2. Modify the existing `redeem()` function to disallow off-chain transfer requests by ensuring that the `tokenOut` parameter cannot be set to a zero address.
