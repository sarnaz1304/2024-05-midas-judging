# Malicious users can still participate in the protocol even after getting blacklisted

## Summary
Malicious users can still participate in the protocol even after getting blacklisted
## Vulnerability Detail
Any malicious user that expects to be blacklisted can just scan the mempool and anticipate getting blacklisted. Whenever he sees a transaction of him getting blacklisted, he can just frontrun it, transfer his `mTBILL` tokens to his secondary account and keep using the protocol like usual. This virtually removes the blacklisting functionality from having any effect as with this trick, no user can ever actually be blacklisted and forbidden from using the protocol and the token.
## Impact
Malicious users can still participate in the protocol even after getting blacklisted

Manual Review

## Recommendation
A fix is not extremely trivial, an option is to use flashbots to conduct the transactions.
