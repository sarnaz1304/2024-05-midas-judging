# `mTBILL` blacklisted users can still successfully call the `transferFrom()` function


## Summary

The README states that users with the `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` should `Cannot access the mTBILL contract`. However, the blacklisted user is still able to call `transferFrom()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The blacklist check is only restricted during the `_beforeTokenTransfer` function. However, the user can still call `transferFrom()`, which means as long as another `mTBILL` holder approves the blacklisted user of some allowance, the blacklisted user can spend it on his behalf.

```solidity
    function _beforeTokenTransfer(
        address from,
        address to,
        uint256 amount
    )
        internal
        virtual
        override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable)
>       onlyNotBlacklisted(from)
>       onlyNotBlacklisted(to)
    {
        ERC20PausableUpgradeable._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
    }
```

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) public virtual override returns (bool) {
        address spender = _msgSender();
        _spendAllowance(from, spender, amount);
        _transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

Note: even though USDT is implemented in the same way, the README clearly states that blacklisted users `Cannot access the mTBILL contract`, which conflicts with the user being able to call `transferFrom()`.

## Impact

Blacklisted users can still access the `transferFrom()` function of `mTBILL`.

## Tool used

Manual review

## Recommendation

Add a blacklist check for the caller in `transferFrom()`.
