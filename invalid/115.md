# Upgradable contract not initialized

## Summary

Upgradable contract not  initialized.

## Vulnerability Detail

`Pausable.sol` inherits `PausableUpgradeable` but not initialized it.

## Impact

Leaving such a contract uninitialized may lead to it being taken over by a malicious user. In Solidity, when implementing upgradeable contracts, it is important to properly initialize them to avoid potential vulnerabilities.

## Code Snippet

(https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/access/Pausable.sol#L28#L30)

```javascript
function __Pausable_init(address _accessControl) internal onlyInitializing {
        __WithMidasAccessControl_init(_accessControl);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

```diff
function __Pausable_init(address _accessControl) internal onlyInitializing {
        __WithMidasAccessControl_init(_accessControl);
+      __Pausable_init();
    }
```
