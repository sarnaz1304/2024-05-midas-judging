# Missing Pause Admin Role Implementation in ManagableVault.sol

## Summary
 The contract lacks a proper implementation for the `pauseAdminRole` function, which is crucial for determining the role required to pause contract operations.
## Vulnerability Detail
The `pauseAdminRole` function is supposed to return the role identifier (e.g., bytes32) for the admin role that has the authority to pause the contract however the `pauseAdminRole` function simply calls the `vaultRole` function.
```solidity
   function pauseAdminRole() public view override returns (bytes32) {
        return vaultRole();
    }
```
```solidity
    function vaultRole() public view virtual returns (bytes32);
```
The `vaultRole` function is declared as virtual, but it's missing an implementation within `ManageableVault.sol` itself.
Without a defined role for `pauseAdminRole`, the pausing functionalities are rendered inoperable.
## Impact
`admin` might not have the necessary privileges to pause the contract if the role isn't properly defined.
We can also see the protocol wants as to pay special attention to this as we can see on the contest page :

We would like for Watsons to look especially at these attack vectors :

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The best way to fix this is to :
* Define `MANAGEABLE_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` in `MidasAccessControlRoles.sol` as :
```solidity
bytes32 public constant  MANAGEABLE_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE = keccak256("MANAGEABLE_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE");
```
* Setup the `admin `role in `MidasAccessControl.sol` :
```solidity
 _setupRole( MANAGEABLE_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE, admin);
 ```
* And update the `vaultRole` function inside `ManageableVault.sol` :
```solidity
 function vaultRole() public view virtual returns (bytes32); 
 {
        return MANAGEABLE_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE;

    }
```
