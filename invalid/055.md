# The ability to add or remove payment tokens does not align with the requirement

## Summary
The current implementation of Midas vault contracts allows the vault admin to add or remove payment tokens through `ManageableVault::addPaymentToken` and `ManageableVault::removePaymentToken` functions. This capability is inconsistent with the project's statement that "Only USDC and mTBILL will be used".

## Vulnerability Detail
The contract allows the vault admin to support multiple payment tokens, such as USDC and USDT, as valid payment tokens in the future. This flexibility introduces the risk of users exploiting potential price discrepancies between supported tokens during depeg events.

For instance, if USDC experiences a depeg event similar to the past incident where its value dropped to $0.74, [news link](https://www.coindesk.com/markets/2024/01/03/usdc-stablecoin-momentarily-depegs-to-074-on-binance/), users could deposit USDC into the vault and redeem the equivalent amount in USDT, effectively profiting from the price difference.

## Impact
Inconsistent contract implementation.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Remove the `ManageableVault::addPaymentToken` and `ManageableVault::removePaymentToken` functionalities.
- Initiated the payment token address with a single payment token in the contract constructor.
