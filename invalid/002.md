# The `mTBILL.sol#burn()` function does not check the allowance for the caller.

## Summary
In the `mTBILL.sol#burn()` function, the allowance for the caller is not checked, so if the address is entered incorrectly, another user's token may be accidentally burned.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `mTBILL.sol#burn()` function is as follows.
```solidity
    function burn(address from, uint256 amount)
        external
        onlyRole(M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)
    {
51:    _burn(from, amount);
    }
```
openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20Upgradeable.sol:
```solidity
    function _burn(address account, uint256 value) internal {
        if (account == address(0)) {
            revert ERC20InvalidSender(address(0));
        }
        _update(account, address(0), value);
    }
```
As you can see above, the `mTBILL.sol#burn()` function does not check the allowance for the caller.
The `mTBILL.sol#burn()` function can only be called by a user with `M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE`, but this caller may accidentally enter `from`address incorrectly when entering parameters.
In this case, the token of the entered address may be unfairly burned without the holder's approval.

## Impact
Tokens may be burned unfairly without the holderâ€™s approval.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a section to check the allowance for the caller to the `mTBILL.sol#burn()` function.
```solidity
    function burn(address from, uint256 amount)
        external
        onlyRole(M_TBILL_BURN_OPERATOR_ROLE, msg.sender)
    {
+++     if(msg.sender != from)
+++     {
+++         address spender = _msgSender();
+++         _spendAllowance(from, spender, value);
+++     }    
        _burn(from, amount);
    }
```
