## Vulnerability Detail

See https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L91-L112

```solidity
    function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        lastRequestId.increment();
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
        require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    }
```

This function is used to deposit, a specific `amountUsdIn` from a `tokenIn` , would be key to note that contrary to what the name suggests, this `amountUsdIn` is the 
amount of **token** to deposit in 10**18 decimals as [clearly documented](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L89), but protocol wrongly assumes that this is the equivalent of the tokens in `USD` value, but that logic is not rightly followed, cause from here `        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);` we can see that `amountUsdIn` is gotten from this token that's to be transferred, however from `_validateAmountUsdIn` protocol wrongly checks this `amountUsdIn` against  `minAmountToDepositInUsd` https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L155-L164

```solidity
    function _validateAmountUsdIn(address user, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        internal
        view
    {
        if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;
        require(
            amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
            "DV: usd amount < min"
        );
    }
```

 

## Impact


The depositing logic in regards to the limitiation is broken which is a core logic for protocol considering they don't want to support dust deposits and try to ensure that the value of supported token deposited must be  >= minAmountToDepositInUsd().

First note that the depositing logic itself is  **completely broken** when the asset to deploy is not == USDT/USDC that we can arguably assume sre pegged to the dollar,  this is because  protocol is then [going to over/undervalue the amount received since the transfer is done on the  `amountUsdIn` value and not the equivalent of the `amountUsdIn` for the token](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L109), and in this case the `minAmount` check would pass when the deviation is not much unlike the cases below.


Alternatively, the below are other noteworthy impacts on how some integrations around tokens that are worth way more/less than a dollar would be broken:

First Case
- Imagine the minimum amount to deposit in `USD`, is 20KUSD making it 20Ke18.
- Now, say SHIBA INU is now supported, this would mean that one can deposit less  cents worth of SHIBA and this check would pass, allowing for anyone to flood the system with dust deposirts
- Alternatively, assume a pricey token like WETH is being supported, this would mean that protocol is going to expect users to deposit crazy amount in USD before they can integrate with protocol, since specifying the real value for 20K USD in ETH `~5.2e18` would always fail when validating the amount.

Second Case
- Imagine the [setMinAmountToDeposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L128-L132) is set to a higher level than previously.
- When new deposits are arriving, [no checks are applied to this new value](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L159)
- That's to say, imagine min deposit value was previosuly `10KUSD` and then it gets increased to `100KUSD`
- If a user previously deposited `15KUSD` they can then come and deposit `10KUSD` more and the transaction doesn't revert, which would be against the `minAmountToDepositInUsd` logic, so here there should be a check if the user has previously deposited, that their `previous deposited value` + `the value being currently deposited` >= new `minAmountToDepositInUsd`.

## Recommendation

For the first case, since tokens are going to be whitelisted before being supported, then integrate their Chainlink feeds to and then when depositing check the value of the `amount` they specify in the trasnaction and confirm if it's above/below the threshold. For the second case apply the hinted fix from the _impact_ section.
