# Decimals for `amountUsdIn` and `minAmountToDepositInUsd` differ, leading to no real min threshold actually being set

## Summary
 
Decimals for amountUsdIn and minAmountToDepositInUsd differ, leading to no real min deposit threshold actually being set

## Vulnerability Detail

Looking at the documentation, `amountUsdIn` is USD in 18 decimals. However, from both the code comments and tests, `minAmountToDepositInEuro` is passed in as just an EUR amount without any decimals. This means that `minAmountToDepositInUsd()`, which looks like the following, also doesn't have decimals in the return value:

```solidity
    function minAmountToDepositInUsd() public view returns (uint256) {
        return
            (minAmountToDepositInEuro * eurUsdDataFeed.getDataInBase18()) /
            10 ** 18;
    }
```

That means in `_validateAmountUsdIn`, we compare the `amountUsdIn`, which has 18 decimals, to a value that never has any decimals, which means that pretty much any reasonable USD input (e.g. $1) will be allowed to bypass the min deposit amount requirement. 

```solidity
    function _validateAmountUsdIn(
        address user,
        uint256 amountUsdIn
    ) internal view {
        if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;
        require(
            amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
            "DV: usd amount < min"
        );
    }
```

## Impact

Min deposit requirement is completely broken
