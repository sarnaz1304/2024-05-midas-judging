# Users could get away with depositing a significantly lower amount than the required minimum

## Summary
Users could get away with depositing a significantly lower amount than the required minimum
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon depositing for the first time, the user's deposit amount has to be above the specified minimum (`minAmountToDepositInEuro`):
```solidity
if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
```
It uses the Euro-USD Chainlink data feed to check whether the USD deposited is more than the Euro required:
```solidity
function minAmountToDepositInUsd() public view returns (uint256) {
        return
            (minAmountToDepositInEuro * eurUsdDataFeed.getDataInBase18()) /
            10**18;
    }
```
However, this can allow a user to successfully deposit significantly less than the amount required.
Based on the sponsors, users are allowed to only deposit USDC. In the case of a depeg such as the one from Mar 11, 2023 (just a year ago), this issue will occur. At that time, USDC was at the price of ≈0.87 USD according to CoinMarketCap and CoinGecko. According to the protocol's docs, the minimum amount of Euro required to deposit will be `100,000€`. That amount of Euro equals `107,937$`. If the price dropped to the same amount as last year, users would be able to deposit just `93,905.19$` or `86,997.52€`, a difference of over `14,000$`.
## Impact
Users could get away with depositing a significantly lower amount than the required minimum
