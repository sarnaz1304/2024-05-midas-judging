# If the minAmountToDepositInUsd is increased by the VaultAdmin, existing users can deposit amounts smaller than the minimum amount

## Summary

The VaultAdmin can change the `minAmountToDepositInEuro` to a new value through the `setMinAmountToDeposit` function. When this value is increased, users that already have made deposits can make deposits which are smaller than the `minAmountToDepositInEuro`.

## Vulnerability Detail

`minAmountToDepositInEuro` = 100k 
Alice deposits 100k 
`totalDeposited[Alice]`= 100k

VaultAdmin then increases the  `minAmountToDepositInEuro` to 500k

Alice deposits another 100k. 
The `_validateAmountUsdIn` function does not check the amount against the minimum amount since `if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;` resolves to true. 

As a result, the increase of the `minAmountToDepositInEuro` by the VaultAdmin is completely ineffective for existing users.  

## Impact

Assuming the protocol intends to use  `minAmountToDepositInEuro` as an invariant to enforce a minimum deposit amount, the current implementation makes this ineffective for existing users.

## Recommendation

Change the `_validateAmountUsdIn` to: 

```solidity 
if (totalDeposited[user] != 0){
        require(
            totalDeposited[user] + amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
            "DV: deposited + usd amount < min"
        );
} else {
        require(
            totalDeposited[user] + amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
            "DV: usd amount < min"
        );
}
```
