# The `initialize` function can be frontrun

## Summary
The `initialize` function can be frontrun

## Vulnerability Detail
The `initialize` function is marked as an `initializer`, which means it can only be called once during the contract's deployment. However, the function does not have any access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized users from calling it.

## Impact
An attacker can frontrun the contract deployment transaction and call the `initialize` function with malicious parameters. 

The attacker can pass into the _eurUsdDataFee parameter the data passed by the original caller to as to conform with `IDataFeed(_eurUsdDataFeed)`. However, the attacker is at liberty to pass into the remaining parameters whatever the attacker wants.

## Tool used
Manual review

## Recommendation
Implement access control mechanisms to ensure that only authorized parties can call the `initialize` function. One approach is to use the OpenZeppelin `OwnableUpgradeable` contract and restrict the `initialize` function to be called only by the contract owner.
