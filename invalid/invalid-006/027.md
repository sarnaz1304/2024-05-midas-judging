# Front-Running Vulnerability in Smart Contract Initialization

## Summary
This vulnerability arises due to the susceptibility of smart contract initialization functions to front-running attacks. During the deployment phase, an attacker can observe pending transactions and submit a higher gas price transaction to alter the initialization parameters, potentially compromising the contract's integrity and intended functionality.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol?plain=1#L70#L82

## Vulnerability Detail
During the contract deployment, the initialization function is exposed to potential front-running attacks. An attacker can monitor the network for pending transactions involving the contract deployment and submit a new transaction with a higher gas price to override the initialization parameters. This could result in the contract being initialized with unintended or malicious configurations, such as setting the` _usdReceiver` to an attacker-controlled address, thereby gaining unauthorized access or control over the contract's assets or functionalities.

## Impact
The primary impacts of this vulnerability include:
- Unauthorized control or access to the contract's assets or functionalities.
- Potential loss of funds or disruption of services.
- Loss of trust in the contract's security and integrity.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
  function initialize(
        address _ac,
        address _mTBILL,
        address _eurUsdDataFeed,
        uint256 _minAmountToDepositInEuro,
        address _usdReceiver
    ) external initializer {
        require(_eurUsdDataFeed != address(0), "zero address");

        __ManageableVault_init(_ac, _mTBILL, _usdReceiver);
        minAmountToDepositInEuro = _minAmountToDepositInEuro;
        eurUsdDataFeed = IDataFeed(_eurUsdDataFeed);
    }

```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
I have provided this code snippet showing steps to mitigate front-running at initialization. Marking the initialize function with the `initializer` modifier, it ensures the function can only be called once, preventing repeated attempts to initialize the contract with different parameters. Restricting access to the` initialize `function to the contract creator (owner) reduces its visibility, making it less appealing for attackers to try front-running. Integrating OpenZeppelin's UUPSUpgradeable and OwnableUpgradeable libraries enhances security and flexibility, enabling future upgrades and ownership management, alongside emitting events for transparency and adding pause functionality for operational control in emergencies or suspected malicious activities.
