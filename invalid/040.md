# Checking may prevent users from depositing

## Summary
The protocol will obtain the chainlink price when depositing. If the price is out of date, the user may not be able to deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol acquisition price is used to [limit the minimum amount of a user's first deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/a4a3cc23bb891913ce44665a4cdea9f5c1190f6c/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L160-L163). However, if the chainlink price becomes outdated, it will result in [revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/a4a3cc23bb891913ce44665a4cdea9f5c1190f6c/midas-contracts/contracts/feeds/DataFeed.sol#L73-L77) even if the user deposits a sufficient amount of assets. Users will not be able to deposit.

## Impact
Users may not be able to deposit properly.
## Code Snippet
```solidity
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to use multiple price sources instead of simply reverting.
