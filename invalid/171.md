# `Pausable.sol::pauseAdminRole` will return 0x00  which gives users with no roles the abillity to pause and unpause.

## Summary
`PauseAdminRole` function inside `Pausable.sol` will return 0x00 value, which causes users with no roles to be able to pause and unpause the protocol.


## Vulnerability Detail

modifier onlyPauseAdmin is used on the `pause` and `unpause` function, which calls for `pauseAdminrole`

```javascript
 */
    modifier onlyPauseAdmin() {
        _onlyRole(pauseAdminRole(), msg.sender);
        _;
    }
 ```
 `_onlyRole` will check  if `pauseAdminRole()` is equal to msg.sender's role. 
 Which is 0x00 which is equal to the base byte32 return given to every user.
 
 Because `pauseAdminRole` does not return anything it will return 0x00
 ```javascript
    /**
     * @dev virtual function to determine pauseAdmin role
     */
    function pauseAdminRole() public view virtual returns (bytes32);
    //
```


 
and when a user has no role, it will return 0x00 which be equal to what the `pauseAdminRole` will return meaning the user will be able to use `pause` and `unpause` in `Pausable.sol`

```javascript

    function pause() external onlyPauseAdmin {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() external onlyPauseAdmin {
        _unpause();
    }

```


## Impact
Users with no roles will be able to pause and unpause the protocol which only admins should be able to to do.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure `pauseadminRole()` returns a byte32 that will not equal the base role of every user, but one of the admin/s
