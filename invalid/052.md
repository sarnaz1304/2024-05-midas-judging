# Unhandled Chainlink revert would lock access to Oracle Price feeds.

## Summary
Chainlink's latestRoundData() is used which could potentially revert and make it impossible to query any prices. This could lead to permanent denial of service.
## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink has taken oracles offline in extreme cases. For example, during the UST collapse, Chainlink paused the UST/ETH price oracle, to ensure that it wasn't providing inaccurate data to protocols.

In such a situation (or one in which the token's value falls to zero), all liquidations requests which are being off-chain will be reverted.
This could happen due to any of these reasons: 
- the call to Chainlink's registry.latestRoundData would fail.
- The following check might fail
 ```solidity
require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"lthy"
        );
```
If the Oracle price lookup reverts, liquidations will be frozen, and the user will be immune to liquidation requests.
## Impact
Liquidations may not be possible at a time when the protocol or user needs them most.

Use a try-catch block mechanism to safeguard against this possibility
