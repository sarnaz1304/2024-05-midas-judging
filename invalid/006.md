# Contract can end up in a DoS under a certain condition

## Summary
Contract can end up in a DoS under a certain condition
## Vulnerability Detail
Users can deposit USDC into the contract and then be minted mTBILL. The USDC gets transferred to the `tokensReceiver`:
```solidity
function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            tokensReceiver,
            amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token))
        );
    }
```
If the `tokensReceiver` gets blacklisted for USDC, then this will lead to a DoS for the deposit functionality. Furthermore, there is no setter function for the `tokenReceiver` and it can only get a value from the initializer function which means that it can't be changed afterwards leading to a permanent DoS.
## Impact
Contract can end up in a DoS under a certain condition. 
According to the contest page, issues that stem from blacklist functionality for the tokens in scope (USDC, mTBILL) will be considered valid thus the issue should be a medium.
