# Proxies `initialize` functions can be called by anyone

## Summary

All proxy contracts have `initialize` functions that anyone can call after deployment. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The proxy `initialize` can be called by an attacker and initialized by his/her configuration. The problem is that `initialize` functions do not have address control modifier. This could be okay if proxy deployment and initialization would happen in some other contract, like a factory in one transaction. But the protocol does not have such contracts accordingly to the docs: https://docs.midas.app/protocol-mechanics/smart-contracts. 

## Impact
Proxy can be initialized by an attacker due to potential race condition and address control modifier absence.
