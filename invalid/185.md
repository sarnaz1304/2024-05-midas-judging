# Opportunity Cost Loss of User's Funds

## Summary

Here the protocol defines the settlement time of T-Bill, which is T + 2 days. Though the protocol does not specify the maximum time for the redemption of the fund after the call redeem function, that may cause the user to miss an opportunity cost.

## Vulnerability Detail

- Users have a deposit of 10 million euros.

- minimum interest rate, we consider 5% p.a.Â 

- if protocol gives funds late after 5 days.

- In this case, the user loses the opportunity cost of 3 days.

- Hence, 10000000 * 3/365 * 5/100

- The calculated opportunity cost is approximately $4,109.59.

## Impact

Opportunity Cost Due to Lack of Maximum Redemption Time Protocol for On-Chain Funds
