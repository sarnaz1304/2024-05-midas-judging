# ERROR IN DECIMAL REPRESENTATION

## Summary
The Management Vault expects deposited tokens to have a decimal value in base 10^18 (18 decimal places). However, the USDC token has a decimal value of 10^6 (6 decimal places). This discrepancy leads to inaccurate handling of deposited USDC amounts.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue arises due to a mismatch between the expected decimal format of the Management Vault and the actual decimal format of the USDC token. This can result in:
Incorrect Value Calculations: The Management Vault might perform calculations with the deposited USDC amount based on the assumption of 18 decimal places, leading to inaccurate results.
## Impact
1 Loss of Funds: Users might deposit USDC, but the Management Vault might not register the full amount due to the decimal mismatch.
2 Operational Issues: The inaccurate calculations could disrupt various functionalities within the Management Vault, potentially causing operational problems.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To mitigate this vulnerability, it's crucial to convert the decimal value of deposited USDC to base 10^18 before sending it to the Management Vault. This can be achieved in two ways:
1.Pre-conversion: Convert the USDC amount to base 10^18 before sending it to the Management Vault. This can be done outside the Vault itself, ensuring that the correct value is used for internal calculations.
2.On-the-fly conversion: Implement logic within the Management Vault to automatically convert the deposited USDC amount to base 10^18 during the deposit process. This approach requires careful consideration to avoid potential rounding errors or overflow issues.
