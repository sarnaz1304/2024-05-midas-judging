## Summary

If access to the `_tokensReceiver` address is compromised or lost, you will not be able to replace it. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In the **ManageableVault** contract, the `tokensReceiver` variable is initialized and assigned an address. 

However, there is nowhere in the contract to change the address of the `tokensReceiver` variable, which means that if access to this address of the wallet or smart contract is lost or hacked, and it is necessary to urgently change the address, it will not be possible to do so. 

All token transfers performed by the `_tokenTransferFromUser` function will be sent to this unreachable address. This means that the tokens will effectively be "lost" for all practical purposes, since they cannot be used if no one has access to this address.

```solidity
function __ManageableVault_init(
        address _ac,
        address _mTBILL,
        address _tokensReceiver
    ) internal onlyInitializing {
        require(_mTBILL != address(0), "zero address");
        require(_tokensReceiver != address(0), "zero address");
        require(_tokensReceiver != address(this), "invalid address");

        mTBILL = IMTbill(_mTBILL);
        __Greenlistable_init(_ac);
        __Pausable_init(_ac);

        tokensReceiver = _tokensReceiver;
    }
```

```solidity
 function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            tokensReceiver,
            amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token))
        );
    }
```





## Impact

Since **tokensReceiver** is used to receive tokens from users, failure to manage this address could result in the contract being unable to perform its core functions, such as managing payments and distributing tokens

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add function to update tokensReceiver variable.

```solidity
function updateTokensReceiver(address newReceiver) external onlyVaultAdmin {
    require(newReceiver != address(0), "zero address");
    require(newReceiver != address(this), "invalid address");
    tokensReceiver = newReceiver;
}
```
