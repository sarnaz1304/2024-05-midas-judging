# Missing Fee Implementation in Deposit and Redeem Functions

## Summary

According to the docs On-ramp fees are currently waived during the launch phase, but there's no implementation of this fee in the deposit and redeem functions.
https://docs.midas.app/protocol-mechanics/how-it-works/fee-structure#:~:text=*On%2Dramp%20fees%20will%20be%20temporarily%20waived%20during%20the%20launch%20phase.

## Vulnerability Detail
On-ramp fees are currently waived during the launch phase, but there's no implementation of this fee in the deposit and redeem functions. This leads to:
1. Inaccurate Minimum Deposit: The minimum deposit value doesn't reflect the actual amount when fees are added later.
2. Inaccurate  Amounts to be redeemed requested because fee will be deducted after launch but it is not implemented.
3. Inaccurate  Redemption amount requested because fee will be deducted after launch but it is not implemented.

## Impact
The amount requested and amount redeemed will be inaccurately calculated also minAmountToDepositInEuro; should reflect the fee to prevent reversion of function when iplemented.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
1. Implement Fee Function:
Add a setFee(uint256 fee) function to the contract, allowing the admin to set the fee percentage (0 or 0.15%).
oEnsure the function only accepts valid fee values (0 or 15) since 10000 has been set has 100% in the management vault.sol.
2. Update Minimum Deposit:
oModify the deposit and redeem functions to incorporate the fee when calculating the minimum deposit amount.

3. Deduct Fee from User:
oIn both deposit and redeem functions, deduct the calculated fee from the user's requested amount.
4. Emit Events:
oUpdate the deposit and redeem events to include the deducted fee amount.
This ensures that:
a. The minimum deposit reflects the actual amount after fees.
b. Users are aware of the fee deduction during transactions.
c. The fee structure is transparent and manageable.
