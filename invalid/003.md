# Using the same heartbeat for multiple price feeds

## Summary
Chainlink price feeds usually updates the price of an asset once it deviates a certain percentage. For example the ETH/USD price feed updates on 0.5% change of price. If there is no change for 1 hour, the price feed updates again - this is called heartbeat:

https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/eth-usd

Chainlink feeds which are used by the protocol, like ETH-USD and BTC-USD have a heartbeat of (1 hour). In those cases, if the prices derived from Chainlink are stale, the protocol will still assume that the prices are healthy because it sets the `uint256 private constant _HEALTHY_DIFF = 3 days;`, which will lead to stale prices.
## Vulnerability Detail
Different chains have different heartbeat. Take for example the ETH/USD pair:

Ethereum: ~1 hour https://data.chain.link/ethereum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

Polygon: ~25 seconds https://data.chain.link/polygon/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

BNB: ~60 seconds https://data.chain.link/bsc/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

Optimism: ~20 minutes https://data.chain.link/optimism/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

Arbitrum: ~24 hours https://data.chain.link/arbitrum/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

Avalanche: ~24 hours https://data.chain.link/avalanche/mainnet/crypto-usd/eth-usd

Also assets on the same chain have different price feeds heartbeats. Take for example Ethereum Mainnet:

BTC / USD: ~1 hour https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/btc-usd

1INCH / USD ~1 day https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/1inch-usd

For example the ETH/USD feed 3 hours would be too large on Ethereum, Polygon and BSC, while it is too small on Avax and Arbitrum.

Having in mind that the contract would be deployed on various chains and use various feeds, it is recommended to have different amount set for each price feed, for each chain.



## Impact
stale price will be fetched from the pricefeeds and in some cases it can also lead to revert.

## Recommendation
Consider saving all the Chainlink AggregatorV3Interface into a mapping and using different stalePeriod for different heartbeats.
