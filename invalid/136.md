# Risk of Fee-on-Transfer Tokens in Deposit Function

## Summary

The current deposit function does not account for fee-on-transfer tokens, posing a significant risk if this feature is implemented in USDC or other supported stablecoins, potentially breaking the deposit logic.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol currently supports USDC for deposits with plans to extend support to other stablecoins, including USDT. Although USDT has a fee-on-transfer feature, it is currently turned off. However, USDC's contract is upgradable, meaning fee-on-transfer functionality could be added in the future, similar to USDT.

If fee-on-transfer is implemented, the deposit function will fail to accurately account for the actual amount of tokens transferred, leading to discrepancies in the deposited amounts. This poses a significant risk as the protocol relies on accurate token transfers for correct operation.

**Example scenario**
1. User deposits 100 USDC.
2. USDC implements a 1% fee-on-transfer.
3. User only transfers 99 USDC to the vault.
4. The protocol inaccurately records 100 USDC, leading to inconsistencies and potential financial loss.

## Code Snippet

Deposit function accounts value transferred by the user (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L108):

```jsx
function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
		...
    totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
    _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    
    emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To mitigate this risk, the protocol should check the contract balance before and after the deposit to determine the exact amount of tokens transferred.
