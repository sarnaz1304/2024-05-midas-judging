# Chainlink's `latestRoundData` might return stale results

## Summary
Chainlink's `latestRoundData` might return stale results. The result of `latestRoundData` API is used in `_getDataInBase18()` function, therefore a stale price from Chainlink can lead to loss of funds to end-users.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function _getDataInBase18()
        private
        view
        returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer)
    {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }
```
The calls to the `latestRoundData()` function do not validate the output of the Chainlink oracle query. As a result, it is possible to use stale results when returning the price. `latestRoundData()` is able to ensure the round is complete and has returned a valid/expected price by validating additional round data. This is documented in chainlink docs.

## Impact
Medium, stale price from Chainlink can lead to loss of funds to end-users

## Recommendation
Change the `_getDataInBase18()` function to the following one:
```solidity
function _getDataInBase18()
        private
        view
        returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer)
    {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(answeredInRound >= _roundId, "Stale price"); //this is the missing check for stale price
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }
```
