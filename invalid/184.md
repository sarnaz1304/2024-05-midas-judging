# `MidasAccessControl::_setupRoles` will not change the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` used in `WithMidasAccesControl`

## Summary
When `_setupRoles` is called it will not change the `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` used in `WithMidasAccessControl` which will let the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE stay `0x00` which means users with no admin roles can call `changeAggregator` function inside `DataFeed.sol` and `setMetadata` inside MTBill.sol`.

withMidasAccessControl will not directly inherit the change made as it uses a separate variable named `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `AccessControlUpgrade` does aswell.

## Vulnerability Detail
Users with no roles will be able to use admin functions like `changeAggregator` which can change the DataFeed for the protocol, which can cause a function like

```javascript
   /**
     * @notice minAmountToDepositInEuro converted to USD in base18
     */
    function minAmountToDepositInUsd() public view returns (uint256) {
        return
            (minAmountToDepositInEuro * eurUsdDataFeed.getDataInBase18()) /
            10**18;
    }
```

To receive other price data which is how user can deposit under the 100k limit set by the protocol team.

## Impact
User can change the protocol invariant of having min 100k deposit entry.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure to set the DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE also inside `withMidasAccessControl` to the admin address at the `_setupRoles` function.
