# The eurUsd Chainlink datafeed is cast directly as IDataFeed, breaking all deposits.

## Summary

In `DepositVault.sol: initialize` the Chainlink `_eurUsdDataFeed` datafeed is cast directly as an IDataFeed interface. This cannot work since the interface contains custom logic that the chainlink datafeed does not implement. 

As such, whenever `minAmountToDepositInEuro * eurUsdDataFeed.getDataInBase18()` is reached, the call will revert, thereby breaking all deposits. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The IDataFeed Interface contains three functions: 
- initialize
- changeAggregator
- getDataInBase18

These are implemented in the `DataFeed` wrapper, which is deployed with a Chainlink datafeed as input. 

However, in `DepositVault.sol: initialize`, the chainlink datafeed is not deployed in a wrapper, but is cast directly as a IDataFeed interface. This is problematic since no datafeed implements the above mentioned functions. 

As as result, whenever the `minAmountToDepositInEuro` is checked during a normal first deposit call, the contract attempts to call `eurUsdDataFeed.getDataInBase18()`, which will always revert. 


## Impact

All deposits will revert, thereby breaking the entire contract.

## Recommendation

Deploy the  `_eurUsdDataFeed` Chainlink datafeed as a  `DataFeed` wrapper.
