# IBO1/USD aggregator is not available in Arbitrum Network

## Summary

Chainlink's IBO1/USD aggregator is only available in Ethereum Mainnet as seen in their [docs](https://data.chain.link/feeds/ethereum/mainnet/ib01-usd), while the protocol intends to also be launched in Arbitrum as mentioned in the contest [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L11) file.

## Vulnerability Detail

I understand that the IBO1/USD aggregator isn't actually used in the protocol at the moment, but in the contest `README` file the IB01/USD data feed is mentioned [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L53) and also in the codebase `README` file [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/README.md?plain=1#L85), implying that the particular aggregator is in scope.

Also asked the `Protocol Team` in a discord private thread about if they want an issue about this particular aggregator to be reported and they answered yes.

>Me: My question is because the IBO1/USD pair is not used in The code, do you want it to work? If we find any issues with it should we report it? Specifically an issue for this pair, not the EUR/USD one 

>Protocol Team: this is only referenced once daily upon reporting, but will review!

## Impact

The IBO1/USD Chainlink aggregator can't be launched in the Arbitrum Network.

## Recommendation

Consider not adding the IBO1/USD feed in the future as mentioned [here](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/README.md?plain=1#L85) and doing the calculations off-chain.
