# DepositVault:: There's a method to enable `isFreeFromMinDeposit` for a particular user, but there's no way to disable that option for that user later, if needed

## Summary
The `freeFromMinDeposit` function enables the privilege of a skipped deposit amount sanitization for a particular user:

```solidity
function freeFromMinDeposit(address user) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        require(!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user], "DV: already free");

        isFreeFromMinDeposit[user] = true;

        emit FreeFromMinDeposit(user);
    }
```

## Vulnerability Detail
If there's a need in the future to remove this privilege from the user that has already been given that privilege before, there'll be no way to do that.

## Impact
**Medium severity.** It doesn't cause direct damage, but *a missing alternative way to disable this option* (after it has been enabled for a particular user) is not implemented in the contract.

Normally, there should be a boolean argument in functions like that, specifying whether the current action is to enable user's access to that privilege, or disable access to the privilege (reducers-like).

This can be refactored in a way similar to how I suggested it in the recommendation section below.
