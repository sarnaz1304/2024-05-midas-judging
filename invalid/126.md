# The `freeFromMinDeposit` function and the code generally lacks the ability to set a user as not free from the minimum deposit requirement

## Summary
The `freeFromMinDeposit` function and the code generally lacks the ability to set a user as not free from the minimum deposit requirement

## Vulnerability Detail
The `freeFromMinDeposit` function only allows setting a user as free from the minimum deposit requirement `(`isFreeFromMinDeposit[user] = true;`)`. 

However, there is no way to revert this state and set a user as not free from the minimum deposit requirement.

## Impact
Once a user is set as free from the minimum deposit requirement, there is no way to undo this state. This could lead to unintended behavior or security issues if a user's status needs to be reverted for any reason.


## Code Snippet
`  function freeFromMinDeposit(address user) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        require(!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user], "DV: already free");

        isFreeFromMinDeposit[user] = true;

        emit FreeFromMinDeposit(user);
    }
`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Modify the `freeFromMinDeposit` function to accept a boolean parameter that determines whether the user should be set as free from the minimum deposit requirement or not. This will allow both setting and unsetting the user's status.

Example Fix:

`function freeFromMinDeposit(address user, bool isFree) external onlyVaultAdmin {
    require(isFreeFromMinDeposit[user] != isFree, "DV: already in desired state");

    isFreeFromMinDeposit[user] = isFree;

    emit FreeFromMinDeposit(user, isFree);
}`
