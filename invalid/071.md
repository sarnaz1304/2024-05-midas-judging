# Users can be BLACKLISTED and GREENLISTED at the same time, making them unable to receive and redeem tokens

## Summary
Users can have both GREENLISTED and BLACKLISTED roles which can impact users ability to receive and redeem tokens.
## Vulnerability Detail
The issue lies in `onlyGreenlisted` check. 
PoC:
Imagine scenario where user for some reason was first given `BLACKLIST_ROLE`, which should restrict user working with protocol. But for some other reason the same user after some time is set by admin to green list and is given `GREENLIST_ROLE`. Which should give user permission to work with the protocol (deposit to receive `mTBILL` tokens and redeem to receive back deposited tokens), the user would not be able to do that because he still is also in the blacklisted group and have `BLACKLIST_ROLE` even now that he is green listed and should be able to deposit and redeem tokens.

## Impact
Greenlisted users (that were blacklisted) can't receive and redeem tokens.
## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/access/Greenlistable.sol#L38C1-L42C7

```javascript
    function _onlyGreenlisted(address account)
        private
        view
        onlyRole(GREENLISTED_ROLE, account)
    {}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Make sure when checking if user is green listed , that he is not also blacklisted and if it is that should be changed, also when it is blacklisted that he is not green listed at the same tame.
Or when setting up user to `GREENLISTED_ROLE` or `BLACKLISTED_ROLE`, have check to see if the user is not already in some of these roles and he should be removed from current role if his role needs to be changed.
