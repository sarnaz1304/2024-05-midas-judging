# `removePaymentToken` function doesn't check Balance exist

## Summary

In the protocol, the admin has the power to add and remove tokens. Here, the crucial part is to remove the token. Using `removePaymentToken` function, the admin removes the addresses that have funds invested by users. This function doesn't check the current available balance of the protocol.

## Vulnerability Detail

```solidity

 function removePaymentToken(address token) external onlyVaultAdmin {  //@audit not checking balance of token while removing
       require(_paymentTokens.remove(token), "MV: not exists");
        emit RemovePaymentToken(token, msg.sender);
    }

```

Here are the `steps` on how it may occur:

- Admin added a new token by using `addPaymentToken`.
- Users deposit that token using the `deposit function`  in depositvault.
- somehow admin wants to remove this address.
- In this case, the admin uses `removePaymentToken` function to remove the address.
- as such there is no check for the balance available in the token admin remove the address.
- When users want to redeem funds using the `redeem function`  it will revert due to the nonexistence of the token.

## Impact

Loss of user Funds.
