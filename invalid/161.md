Manual Review

## Recommendation
check if the withdrawTo is blocklisted
```solidity
function withdrawToken(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address withdrawTo
    ) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        onlyNotBlacklisted(withdrawTo);

        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(withdrawTo, amount);

        emit WithdrawToken(msg.sender, token, withdrawTo, amount);
```
