# Lack of Tracking for Redeemed mTBILL Tokens in RedemptionVault Contract

## Summary

The `RedemptionVault.sol` contract does not track the redemption of `mTBILL` tokens by users, which leads to an incomplete record of user balances and activities. This issue can result in discrepancies between the amount deposited and the amount redeemed by users.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `DepositVault.sol` contract, the `totalDeposited` mapping tracks the total amount deposited by each user:
```solidity
        require(amountTBillIn > 0, "RV: 0 amount");
```
However, the `RedemptionVault.sol` contract does not update this mapping when `mTBILL` tokens are redeemed. As a result, there is no record of the amount of mTBILL tokens that have been redeemed by each user. This lack of tracking can lead to issues in accurately determining user balances and can cause inconsistencies in the system's overall accounting.

## Impact

The lack of tracking for redeemed `mTBILL` tokens can lead to inaccurate user balance records, causing potential disputes and confusion in calculations.

## Recommendation

Implement a mechanism to update the `totalDeposited` mapping in the `DepositVault.sol` contract when `mTBILL` tokens are redeemed.
