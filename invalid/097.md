# TOKEN MISHANDLING

Medium
## Summary 
in the withdraw Token, there is no check to ensure that the token is an allowed token 

## Vulnerability Detail
In the `withdrawToken` function in `ManageableVault.sol` which is called by a vault admin, it transfers a token to the address, but it doesn't check if the token is allowed or if the token is a member of `_paymentTokens` array, which can allow the transfer of an invalid token

## Impact
 1. Transfer of an invalid Amount of a  Token

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
add a check to ensure that the token is an allowed Token
```solidity
   
function withdrawToken(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address withdrawTo
    ) external onlyVaultAdmin {
        _requireTokenExists(token);
        IERC20(token).safeTransfer(withdrawTo, amount);
        emit WithdrawToken(msg.sender, token, withdrawTo, amount);
    }
```
