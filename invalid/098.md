# User can be redeemed more tokens than they deposited.

## Summary
Users can redeem more tokens than they deposited. Even users who never deposited can be redeemed rewards.
`GREENLISTED_ROLE , RESTRICTED`

## Vulnerability Detail
User A deposits $1,000 worth of USDC. The user's total deposited amount is [increased](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L108), but when redeeming, there is no internal accounting to prevent the user from redeeming more than they deposited and thus a a malicious  GREENLISTED_ROLE can transfer more tokens than user deposited when redeeming. Similarly, a malicious  GREENLISTED_ROLE can transfer tokens to users who didn't deposit at all.

## Impact
Loss of funds for the protocol.
