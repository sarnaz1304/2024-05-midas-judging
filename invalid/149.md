# Users can loose their funds when redeeming

## Summary
Users can lose their funds when redeeming tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
If a user deposits 1 ether worth of `USDC` to mint 1,000,000 `IMTbill` tokens, there is an issue when redeeming the USDC. An event emits  `1,000,000` instead of `1 ether` as the event is listened to, to determine how much `USDC` would be sent back to the user, causing the user to lose a significant portion of their deposit. Specifically, the user receives only 1e6 worth of USDC instead of the full 1ether worth deposited.


## Impact
