# deposit and redeem functions lack slippage mechanism

## Summary

The protocol allows users to deposit USDC and receive mTBILL tokens, and users can redeem the underlying USDC at any time by providing mTBILL tokens. This process occurs in two steps: The user deposits USDC and creates a request, which is then processed off-chain by the team. The team transfers mTBILL tokens to the user based on the current exchange rate. However, changes in the exchange rate between deposit/redeem and the actual transfer of tokens can result in losses for the user due to the lack of a slippage mechanism.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
    function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        lastRequestId.increment(); //lastRequest= lastRequest + 1
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
           _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
        require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;//@audit-issue add more than transfer
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    }
```
```solidity
function redeem(address tokenOut, uint256 amountTBillIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        require(amountTBillIn > 0, "RV: 0 amount");

        address user = msg.sender;

        lastRequestId.increment();
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        _requireTokenExists(tokenOut);
        _tokenTransferFromUser(address(mTBILL), amountTBillIn);
      
        emit Redeem(requestId, user, tokenOut, amountTBillIn);
    }
```
Both the deposit and redeem functions lack a slippage mechanism. Without this, users are vulnerable to changes in the USDC/mTBILL exchange rate between the time they initiate a deposit/redeem and the time the actual token transfer occurs. This can make the trade unprofitable for the user if the exchange rate shifts unfavorably. Given that the process occurs in two steps, even a slight delay can lead to significant losses for the user. 

## Impact
Users may experience financial losses due to the absence of slippage protection

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a previewDeposit/previewRedeem methods which will give the current expected output tokens and then user can choose for slippage as they wish
