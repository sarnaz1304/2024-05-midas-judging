# DataFeed contract does not exist on Arbitrum, resulting in DOS

## Summary
The DataFeed contract relies on Chainlink Oracle to get the latest token price. However the [IB01/USD](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses/?network=arbitrum&amp%3Bpage=1&page=1&search=IB01%2FUSD) Data Streams does not exist on Arbitrum. This means depositing USDC in the DepositVault contract will always revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
When depositing USDC for the first time into the deposit vault there is a check that the `amountUsdIn` is larger or equals the `minAmountToDepositInEuro` where the price is fetched from the Oracle. Because the Oracle does not exists and there is a revert when the `_answer` is 0 it results in DOS and every deposit will revert.

## Impact
The DataFeed contract will revert on Arbitrum resulting in DOS.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Only deploy on Ethereum in the beginning and wait until the IB01/USD price feed becomes available on Arbitrum
