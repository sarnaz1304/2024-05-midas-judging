# Depositors can be prevented from depositing an amount below the minimum deposit threshold even if it's not their first deposit

## Summary

Users who has already performed a deposit cannot make another deposit with an amount lower than the deposit threshold.

## Vulnerability Detail

The documentation says this about [Minimum Deposit Check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/README.md?plain=1#L114) :

```text
Minimum Deposit Check: The minimum deposit threshold is only applied to first-time depositors due to the condition in the validateAmountUsdIn() function. This is intended, as this validation is only required for a user's first deposit.
```

In other words, the amount to be deposited must be greater than the `minAmountToDepositInUsd()` **only** for a user's first deposit.

Here's the function used to [deposit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L91-L112) funds in the Midas protocol

```solidity
function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        lastRequestId.increment();
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

@-->    if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
        require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    }
```

Unless the user is free from minimum deposit, he has to approve an amount greater than the deposit threshold to the `DepositVault` for the deposit to be succeed.

Here's what the [documentation](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/README.md?plain=1#L96C1-L106C123) says about the deposit's process.

```text
Deposit is the process of minting mTBILL tokens by transferring USD tokens from user. The exchange ratio is determined by the vault administrator individually for each deposit. USD tokens are stored on the admin`s wallet

The process consists of 2 steps:

1. Deposit request initiation.
2. Deposit request fulfillment.
The initiation is done by the user that wants to transfer his USD tokens and receive mTBILL token instead. After the initiation of transaction, his USD tokens are immediately transferred from him, and now he needs to wait for deposit request fulfillment from the vault administrator.

The fulfillment is done by the vault administrator. Administrator should deposit the funds to the bank, calculate the output mTBILL amount and mint corresponding amount of mTBILL to the user. The exchange ratio and the fees are calculated by the project owner off-chain

Administrator may also decide to cancel the deposit request. In this case, admin will transfer USD tokens back to the user
```

As it's not specified, we can consider that a user is not automatically set `freeFromMinDeposit` when his deposit request is fulfilled.

In that conditions, the following scenario is very likely to happens.

```text
1. Alice makes a deposit request (d1) of an amount equals to or greater than the deposit threshold. This is the firs deposit of Alice.

2. The vault administrator does D1 fulfillment.

3. Alice makes a redeem request (R1) of all her funds.

4. The vault administrator does R1 fulfillment. At this point, Alice isn't a first-time depositor anymore.

5. Alice performs a second deposit request (D2), this time with an amount lower than the deposit threshold.
```

The last transaction will fail, even if it's not the first deposit of Alice.

This breaks the protocol behavior and prevent Alice from deposit in the Midas protocol.

## Proof of Concept

Place the code for the following test function in `test/DepositVault.test.ts`

```typescript
it.only('should fail: when deposit amount > minAmountToDepositTest, then remove all and deposit amount < minAmountToDepositTest', async () => {
      const {
        depositVault,
        redemptionVault,
        accessControl,
        mockedAggregator,
        mockedAggregatorEur,
        owner,
        mTBILL,
        stableCoins,
      } = await loadFixture(defaultDeploy);
      await addPaymentTokenTest(
        { vault: depositVault, owner },
        stableCoins.dai,
      );
      await setRoundData({ mockedAggregator }, 4);

      await mintToken(stableCoins.dai, owner, 100_000);
      await approveBase18(owner, stableCoins.dai, depositVault, 100_000);
      await greenList(
        { accessControl, greenlistable: depositVault, owner },
        owner,
      );

      await setRoundData({ mockedAggregator: mockedAggregatorEur }, 1);
      await setMinAmountToDepositTest({ depositVault, owner }, 100_000);

      await deposit({ depositVault, owner, mTBILL }, stableCoins.dai, 100_000);

      await addPaymentTokenTest(
        { vault: redemptionVault, owner },
        stableCoins.dai,
      );
      await mintToken(mTBILL, owner.address, 100_000);
      await approveBase18(owner, mTBILL, redemptionVault, 100_000);
      await redeem(
        { redemptionVault, owner, mTBILL },
        stableCoins.dai,
        100_000,
      );

      await mintToken(stableCoins.dai, owner, 100_000);
      await setMinAmountToDepositTest({ depositVault, owner }, 100_000);
      await deposit({ depositVault, owner, mTBILL }, stableCoins.dai, 99_999);
    });
```

Make sure to add `import { redeem } from './common/redemption-vault.helpers';` at the end of the import section of the file and run `yarn test` in the terminal.

The test doesn't revert, which means Alice was prevented from depositing an amount lower than the deposit threshold even if it's wasn't her first deposit.

## Impact

Although the behavior of the protocol is the opposite, users are subject to the minimum deposit threshold, even if it's not their first deposit.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

I recommend the vault administrator set the depositor free from minimum deposit when fulfilling the latter's first deposit request or update the documentation to make it clear that a user who has deposited several times may be prevented from depositing an amount below the deposit threshold, unless the vault administrator sets him free from minimum deposit.
