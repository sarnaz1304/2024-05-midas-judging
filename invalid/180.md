# Incorrect Conversion Method in `redeem` Function Leading to Potential Loss of Funds

## Summary
The `redeem` function in the `RedemptionVault` contract uses an incorrect conversion method (`convertFromBase18`), which can lead to incorrect redemption amounts if the input amount is already in the token's native decimal format. This can result in users receiving less than the intended amount of the redemption token, causing financial discrepancies and potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `redeem` function in the `RedemptionVault` contract uses an incorrect conversion method (`convertFromBase18`), which can lead to incorrect redemption amounts if the input amount is already in the token's native decimal format. This can result in users receiving less than the intended amount of the redemption token, causing financial discrepancies and potential loss of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `redeem` function is designed to allow users to redeem their mTBILL tokens for another token (e.g., USDC). The amount of mTBILL tokens (`amountTBillIn`) is expected to be in base 18 format. However, the function uses the `convertFromBase18` method, which converts the amount from 18 decimals to the target token's decimals (e.g., 6 for USDC). This conversion is incorrect because the `amountTBillIn` should already be in the correct format, leading to an additional and erroneous scaling down.

### Detailed Example

Consider the scenario where a user wants to redeem 100 mTBILL (an 18 decimal token) for USDC (a 6 decimal token):

1. **User Input**: The user calls `redeem(tokenOut, 100 * 10**18)`, where `amountTBillIn` is `100 * 10**18`.
2. **Expected Conversion**:
   - The function should transfer `100 * 10**18` mTBILL, but due to the conversion method used, it performs:

  ```solidity
   amountInTokenDecimals = (100 * 10**18).convertFromBase18(6);
  ```
   - This scales down the amount to `100 * 10**6`, which is significantly less.
3. **Actual Transfer**:
   - The contract attempts to transfer `100 * 10**6` (100 USDC) instead of `100 * 10**18` (correct mTBILL amount).
4. **Result**:
   - The user receives only 100 USDC worth of mTBILL, whereas they should have received the equivalent of `100 * 10**18`.

**Numeric Difference**

- 100 USDC in 6 decimals: 100,000,000

- 100 USDC in 18 decimals: 100,000,000,000,000,000,000

### Calculation Details:

- **Incorrect Calculation**:
  ```solidity
  amountInTokenDecimals = (100*10**18).convertFromBase18(6); // Incorrect
  // Converts to:
  amountInTokenDecimals = 100 * 10**6; // Wrongly scaled down to 100 USDC
  ```

- **Correct Calculation**:
  ```solidity
  // If the conversion is not applied, the amount remains correct:
  amountInTokenDecimals = 100 * 10**18; // Correctly retains 100 mTBILL
```

## Impact
The incorrect conversion can cause users to receive significantly less than the intended amount of the redemption token. This discrepancy can lead to financial losses for users and undermine the integrity of the redemption process within the contract.
### Potential Scenarios:
- Users redeeming mTBILL for USDC or other tokens will receive a smaller amount than intended.
- Financial discrepancies can result in user dissatisfaction and potential loss of trust in the platform.
- In extreme cases, users may exploit this issue to manipulate redemption amounts.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Ensure the `amountTBillIn` is correctly handled without unnecessary conversions. 
I am not sure about this recommendation but this may help saving the losses.

```diff
function redeem(address tokenOut, uint256 amountTBillIn)
    external
    onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
    whenNotPaused
{
    require(amountTBillIn > 0, "RV: 0 amount");

    address user = msg.sender;

    lastRequestId.increment();
    uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

    _requireTokenExists(tokenOut);
    // No conversion needed if amountTBillIn is already in 18 decimals
-   _tokenTransferFromUser(address(mTBILL), amountTBillIn);
     // Transfer mTBILL tokens directly to the user's address
+    IERC20(address(mTBILL)).safeTransferFrom(user, tokenOut, amountTBillIn);

    emit Redeem(requestId, user, tokenOut, amountTBillIn);
}
```
