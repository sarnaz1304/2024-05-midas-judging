# `_getDataInBase18()` could return the wrong price in case of a sudden price crash between EUR/USD pricing

## Summary
The returned value from `_getDatainBase18()` might return a value that is lower or higher than the intended `minAmountToDepositInUsd()` due to the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` from the Chainlink aggregator contract leading to a green listed user being able to buy T-bills at a discounted/inflated price.

## Vulnerability Detail
The best practice is to fetch the required data feed through the [AggregatorV3Interface](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference) and run functions on the proxy contract instead. However, the actual Chainlink aggregator contract is called [AccessControlledOffChainAggregator](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/api-reference), which also contains circuit breakers that return the `minAnswer` and `maxAnswer` in case of sudden price fluctuations. This means a fixed value will be returned if the 'minAnswer` or `maxAnswer` has been reached, regardless of the actual value.

## Impact
A green-listed user might be able to buy short-dated T-bills at a discounted price if the actual value of the function `minAmountToDepositInUsd()` is higher than the returned value.

```solidity
    function minAmountToDepositInUsd() public view returns (uint256) {
        return
            (minAmountToDepositInEuro * eurUsdDataFeed.getDataInBase18()) /
            10**18;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Either override the circuit-breakers by the Chainlink aggregators to instead revert or add custom circuit-breakers that are more in line with Midas' intentions. Pseudo-code below for the `_getDataInBase18()` function:

```solidity
...
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF, 
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
       require(_answer >= maxPrice, "DF: answer larger than maxPrice");
       require (_answer >= minPrice, "DF: answer smaller than minPrice");
```
