# A User can deposit below minAmountToDepositInEuro first time

## Summary

Protocol make sure that first time users are depositing more than `minAmountToDepositInEuro`, but due to rounding errors a user can deposit below minAmountToDepositInEuro and brake this invariant

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);//@audit check it reverts or retturn T/F

        lastRequestId.increment(); //lastRequest= lastRequest + 1
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
        require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    }
```
Deposits make sure that for the first time user deposits more than `minAmountToDepositInEuro ` for the first time. So to check this it calls `_validateAmountUsdIn()` which revert if `amountUsdIn` is less than `minAmountToDepositInUsd()`

```solidity
   function minAmountToDepositInUsd() public view returns (uint256) {
        return
            (minAmountToDepositInEuro * eurUsdDataFeed.getDataInBase18()) /
            10**18;
    }
```
For calculating the corresponding value of minAmountToDepositInEuro in USD , it used EUR/USD priceFeed from chainlink which returns value EUR in terms of USD in 8 decimals which is then multiplied by 10**12 for making comparisons

In short it checks if `amountUsdIn >=( (minAmountToDepositInEuro * (EUR Price in USD in 8 decimals * 1e12) ) / 1e18 )`

The core issue is that amountUsdIn  is in 18 decimals and the actual transfer amount is truncated upto 6 decimals for USDC. A user can play with all the number which are going to truncated anyway during transfers and bypass this check

As amountUsdIn is not actual transfer amount. Actual transfer amount is (amountUsdIn / 1e12) so rest truncated 12 digits can be anything which will help the bypass the above check. 


## Impact
A core invariant is broken as User will be able to deposit below minAmountToDepositInEuro  for the first time

## Recommendation

Make sure that transfer USDC amount value if greater than minAmountToDepositInEuro  instead of `amountUsdIn` since `amountUsdIn` and actual transfer USDC amount is not same
