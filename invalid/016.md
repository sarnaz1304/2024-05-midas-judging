# EUR/USD Aggregator feed has different contract address on Arbitrum than on Ethereum

## Summary
When Deploying the DataFeed contract only the EUR/USD contract address on Ethereum is set, because the contract address is different on Arbitrum. 

[EUR/USD Arbitrum Aggregator Address](https://arbiscan.io/address/0xA14d53bC1F1c0F31B4aA3BD109344E5009051a84)
[EUR/USD Ethereum Aggregator Address](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb49f677943BC038e9857d61E7d053CaA2C1734C1)

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability is set in the `deploy_DataFeed.ts` where only the Ethereum Mainnet addresses are set. This results in setting the wrong address on Arbitrum, resulting in a broken protocol.

## Impact
The DataFeed contract will revert on Arbitrum resulting in DOS.
