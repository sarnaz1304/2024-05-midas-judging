# USDC blacklist and ``tokensReceiver`` being a single point of failure.

## Summary
``tokensReceiver`` can't be updated once it is set and ``USDC`` has a blacklist mechanism(which is in scope). Thus, ``tokensReceiver`` getting blacklisted by ``USDC`` can render the protocol useless. But, Even though there is a mechanism to add new payment tokens, it is mentioned explicitly in the ``ReadMe`` that ``Only USDC and mTBILL will be used so only those will be in the scope of the audit``. 
 
## Vulnerability Detail
``tokensReceiver`` is the address to which ``USDC`` and ``mTokens`` is sent sent from ``deposit()`` function of ``DepositVault`` and ``redeem()`` function of ``RedemptionVault``.

```solidity
    function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, tokensReceiver, amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token)));
    }
```

```solidity
    function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn) external onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
...
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
...

    }
```

```solidity
    function redeem(address tokenOut, uint256 amountTBillIn) external onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender) whenNotPaused {
...
        _tokenTransferFromUser(address(mTBILL), amountTBillIn);
...
    }
```

``tokensReceiver`` value is set during initialization and it can't be changed again and It is mentioned explicitly in the ``ReadMe`` that ``Only USDC and mTBILL will be used so only those will be in the scope of the audit``. Thus, no new payment token will be added as per ``ReadMe``.

## Impact
If ``tokensReceiver`` gets blacklisted by USDC, the whole protocol needs to redeployed again.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a method to modify the ``tokensReceiver`` in case ``tokensReceiver`` is blacklisted by ``USDC``.
