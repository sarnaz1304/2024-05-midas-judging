# Missing circuit breaker checks in `DataFeeds.sol`

## Summary
## Vulnerability Detail
Chainlink price aggregator has built in check if the asset market's price hits minAnswer/maxAnswer, it return the either minAnswer or maxAnswer, instead of the actual price, result in the incorrect price usage throughout the protocol .
## Impact
During [LUNA](https://rekt.news/venus-blizz-rekt/) crash, this is what happened to Venus on BSC, the assets are valued at higher price(minAnswer) than their actual market price, Anyone was able to buy up large quantities of LUNA at market price and use it as collateral (valued at $0.10) to borrow funds from the platforms.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Since there is going to be a whitelist of tokens to be added, the minPrice/maxPrice could be checked and a revert could be made when this is returned by chainlink.
