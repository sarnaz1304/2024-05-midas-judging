# green listed users who are not free from minimum deposit cannot increase their deposit position

## Summary
Green listed users can make deposits into the `DepositVault` contract by calling `deposit(...)` with their preferred deposit amount. For first time depositors they is a check to ensure they are not making less than the minimum deposit amount allowed by the protocol. thereafter their `totalDeposited[user]` is increased accordingly.

However, if a user has previously deposited and intends to increase their token deposit and get more `mTBil`, they wouldn't be able to because `_validateAmountUsdIn(...)` function will revert.

## Vulnerability Detail
As shown on `L168`, if a user has already made a deposit before and is not yet free to deposit the `minAmountToDepositInUsd()` the function call returns and terminates without checking if the `amountUsdIn` the user is adding to his position still passes the specified `minAmountToDepositInUsd()` value and as such the user is not able to add to his position


```solidity

91:     function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
92:         external

94:         whenNotPaused
95:     {
96:         address user = msg.sender;

105: @>      }
106:         require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");
107: 
108:         totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
109:         _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
...

112:     }


164:     function _validateAmountUsdIn(address user, uint256 amountUsdIn)
165:         internal
166:         view
167:     {
168:  @>     if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;
169:         require(
170:             amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
171:             "DV: usd amount < min"
172:         );
173:     }

```


## Impact
Users cannot increase their deposited USD token because of a logical flaw in the `_validateAmountUsdIn(...)` function.

## Tool used
Manual Review


## Recommendation
Modify the `_validateAmountUsdIn(...)` function as shown below

```solidity
File: DepositVault.sol

164:     function _validateAmountUsdIn(address user, uint256 amountUsdIn)
165:         internal
166:         view
167:     {

168:   -     if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;
169:   -     require(
170:   -         amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
171:   -         "DV: usd amount < min"
172:   -     );

168:   +     if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) {
169:   +         require(
170:   +             amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
171:   +             "DV: usd amount < min"
172:   +         );
173:   +     }
174:     }

```
