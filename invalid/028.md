# Ensure mTBILL Token Issuance in the DepositVault Contract

## Summary

The `DepositVault.sol` contract facilitates the deposit of USD tokens but fails to issue mTBILL tokens in return. This oversight could lead to user dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies as users do not receive any tokens in exchange for their deposit.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit()` function in the `DepositVault.sol` contract accepts a `tokenIn` and `amountUsdIn` but does not issue any `mTBILL` tokens in return for the deposit.

**Numerical Example**

A user deposits 100 USD tokens.
The `deposit()` function is called with `tokenIn` as the USD token address and `amountUsdIn` as 100 * 10**18 (to handle 18 decimal places).

**Expected Behavior:**

The user should receive 100 `mTBILL` tokens (assuming a 1:1 exchange rate for simplicity).

**Current Behavior:**

The user deposits 100 USD tokens, but no `mTBILL` tokens are issued.

The current contract implementation does not include the minting of `mTBILL` tokens for the deposited amount. The expected behavior is to mint and transfer `mTBILL` tokens to the user proportional to their deposit.

## Impact

Users might expect to receive `mTBILL` tokens in return for their deposits, which is a standard expectation in deposit contracts. Without receiving any `mTBILL` tokens, users have no incentive to deposit their USD tokens.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement logic to mint `mTBILL` tokens equivalent to the deposited amount and transfer them to the user.
