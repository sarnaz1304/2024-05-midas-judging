# Users deposit state is not updated when `mTBill` is redeemed breaking core protocol functionality

## Summary
users deposit USD into the `DepositVault` contract to get `mTBill` in return, to redeem their deposited USD or token selected by the admin, users have to call the `RedemptionVault::redeem(...)` function to transfer their `mTBill` to the admin after which a selected `tokenOutAmount` is sent to the user.

## Vulnerability Detail
The problem is that the users initial deposit in the `DepositVault` contract is written to the `DepositVault` storage during deposit but is not reduced during redemption, this breaks core protocol functionality in a few ways explained below
- if the user is not free from making minimum deposit (i.e isFreeFromMinDeposit[user] = false) and the user  tries to deposit again to get some mTBills the function would return without making it impossible for the user to deposit
 
```solidity
    function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        lastRequestId.increment();
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

@>      if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) { 
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
```
because the amount the user is trying to deposit would not be validated as hown below
```solidity
    function _validateAmountUsdIn(address user, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        internal
        view
    {
 @>     if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;
        require(
            amountUsdIn >= minAmountToDepositInUsd(),
            "DV: usd amount < min"
        );
    }
```
- if the user is free to make minimum deposit (i.e `isFreeFromMinDeposit[user] = true`) then the additional deposit would be added to the users previous deposit which gives a false sense of the users USD balance in the `DepositValut`.
    - say a user initially deposited 1_000_000USD which is above the `minAmountToDepositInUsd()` at the time of deposit and is minted say 1_000_000mTBill for instance.
    - user calls `RedemptionVault::redeem(...)` to redeem their `mTBill` for a token selected by the admin.
    - user wants to invest in `mTBill` at a later time, and calls `deposit(...)` with 1_000_000USD which is above the `minAmountToDepositInUsd()` at the time of deposit and is minted say 1_000_000mTBill still but his balance in the `DepositVault` contract is now 2_000_000USD instead of 1_000_000USD. This breaks accounting of the users position in the `DepositVault` contract.

## Impact
`DepositVault` storage is not updated breaking 
- core protocol functionality
- user accounting in the `DepositVault` contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider reducing the users balance in proportion to the amount of the  selected token the admin transfers to the user when they redeem their `mTBill`
