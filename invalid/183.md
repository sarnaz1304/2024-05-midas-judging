# A user can redeem some else token other than the deposited one, which can cause issue for other users.

## Summary
A user can redeem some else token other than the deposited one, which can cause issue for other users.

## Vulnerability Detail
While depositing , a user deposit USD like stablecoins. 

Now considering the in scope token is USDC for depositing.

But this protocol is going to be deployed on Arbitrum. So the tokens which could be deposited can be USDC.e (Bridged USDC) & USDC( Arbitrum-native USDC ).

Now the deposited tokens are being transferred to a `tokenReciever` address from `_tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn) ` function.

But the issue is , when redeeming would be done.
If these tokens would be redeemed & given back to the users from this `tokenReciever` address only.

Then lets say Alice deposits x amount of USDC token, Bob deposits x amount of USDC.e tokens.

Both users will gets most probably same amout of mTBILL, since both deposited same amount of tokens.

But where issue can arise is, while redeeming using redeem function : 
```javascript
function redeem(address tokenOut, uint256 amountTBillIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        require(amountTBillIn > 0, "RV: 0 amount");

        address user = msg.sender;

        lastRequestId.increment();
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        _requireTokenExists(tokenOut);
        _tokenTransferFromUser(address(mTBILL), amountTBillIn);

        emit Redeem(requestId, user, tokenOut, amountTBillIn);
    }
```

Bob puts the `tokenOut` as USDC, and not USDC.e (which was the one he actually deposited).

As you can see in the above code, there's no check for whether the user is redeeming the same token he deposited or not.

And hence Bob will be able to redeem USDC tokens instead of USDC.e.

And afterwards, when Alice would be trying to redeem her USDC tokens, she won't be able to since, `tokenReciever` address won't have enough USDC tokens to give back to Alice.

Yes here she can redeem USDC.e, but she won't be able to know about this and would cause issue for redeeming here tokens out.
Considering a protocol where things want to be acted in decentralized manner, this would decrease the smoothness of the redeemption process.

Also , USD like tokens prices may vary token to token, even if there's a slight change for huge amount like 100K the loss can increase, since Alice didn't got her own deposited token, there can be chance where her token price was high and Bob's token price was low,  but Bob got profitted & Alice was in loss, because of this lack of functionality.

## Impact
Users can get issue AS MENTIONED ABOVE .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
There should be a tracking of user's deposited token's address, maybe with a mapping tokenDeposited(address -> address)
And while redeeming, it should be checked, whether `tokenOut == tokenDeposited[user]` , if not then it should revert.

This would prevent a user from redeeming some other token , instead of the one he deposited.
And hence would prevent from having issues for other users.
