# Non-Compliance with ERC-20 Standard

## Summary
The `mTBILL` contract, despite claims of strict `ERC-20` compliance in the project's documentation, deviates from the `ERC-20` standard by omitting several required functions. This non-compliance impacts interoperability, transparency, and user experience.
According to protocol :
```Markdown
Is the codebase expected to comply with any EIPs? Can there be/are there any deviations from the specification?
mTBILL should be strictly compliant with the ERC20.
```
## Vulnerability Detail
* The `mTBILL` contract lacks the following functions mandated by the `ERC-20` standard
     *  `totalSupply()`
     *  `balanceOf(address tokenOwner)`
     *  `allowance(address tokenOwner, address spender)`
     *  ` transfer(address to, uint tokens)`
     *  `approve(address spender, uint tokens)`
     *  `transferFrom(address from, address to, uint tokens)`
## Impact
The absence of standard `ERC-20` functions hinders the mTBILL token's ability to interact seamlessly with other `ERC-20` compliant contracts and decentralized applications (dApps) within the Ethereum ecosystem. This limits its potential use in various DeFi protocols.
Check [EIP-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20l) for more information.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure full `ERC-20` compliance and maximize the token's utility, the development team should promptly add the missing functions to the `mTBILL `contract. This will improve interoperability, transparency, and usability.
