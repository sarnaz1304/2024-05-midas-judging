# IB01 / USD chainlink data feed  is not deployed Arbitrium

## Summary
The IB01 / USD Chainlink data feed is a crucial component of the project’s smart contracts. However, it has been identified that this data feed is not currently deployed on the Arbitrum network. This discrepancy poses significant issues as the project is intended to be deployed on both Ethereum and Arbitrum according to the project documentation.

## Vulnerability Detail
Data Feed Dependency:

The IB01 / USD data feed is integral to the contract’s functionality, providing essential pricing data required for various operations within the smart contract.

Deployment Discrepancy:

Although the project is designed to be operational on both Ethereum and Arbitrum, the absence of the IB01 / USD data feed on Arbitrum creates a critical functionality gap.
This discrepancy can lead to inconsistencies in the contract’s behavior and functionality between the two networks.

## Impact
Contract Functionality:

The contract’s functionality on Arbitrum is compromised, potentially leading to failures in execution or incorrect operations due to the lack of necessary pricing data.

Deployment Viability:

The viability of deploying on Arbitrum is questioned without ensuring all necessary data feeds are available and functional.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Deploy IB01 / USD Data Feed on Arbitrum:

Ensure that the IB01 / USD Chainlink data feed is deployed and fully operational on the Arbitrum network to maintain consistency across both networks.

Coordinate with Chainlink to expedite the deployment of the required data feed on Arbitrum.
