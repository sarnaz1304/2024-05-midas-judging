# Deposit of users who are not free from minimum deposit will always revert when the deposit functio is called

## Summary
Deposit of users who are not free from minimum deposit will always revert when the deposit functio is called

## Vulnerability Detail
In the deposit function, it calls the _validateAmountUsdIn function when users are not free from minimum deposit. 

Now, in the _validateAmountUsdIn function, it checks for the below:

`   if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;`

That is, if the user depositing doesn't have 0 amount as totalDeposited, the the deposit function should revert. What this means is that, for every user not exempted from minimum deposit, the user must have 0 as totalDeposited for the mentioned check above to pass. If not, the deposit function would revert.

## Impact
It means that all previous authorized users who have more than 0 amount as totalDeposited and are not free from the minimum deposit condition cannot will have their transaction revert when they call the deposit function - despite being authorized to deposit.


## Code Snippet

`    if (totalDeposited[user] != 0) return;`

            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
