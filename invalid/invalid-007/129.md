# Blacklisted users can still deposit into the system

## Summary
Blacklisted users can still deposit into the system
## Vulnerability Detail
Blacklisted users are allowed to deposit into the system. This is the `DepositVault#deposit()` function:
```solidity
function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        lastRequestId.increment();
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
        require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    }
```
Users can deposit USDC and then be minted `mTBILL` off-chain. The only requirement to call this function is for the user to be greenlisted. This allows a blacklisted user who still has the greenlisted role to deposit into the contract. While the minting of `mTBILL` would later fail, the USDC would still be transferred to the receiver and the deposit function would be called successfully creating a dissynchronization as the user successfully deposited but wasn't minted anything. A similar situation can occur with `RedemptionVault#redeem()` as well.
