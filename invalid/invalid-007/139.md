# User could get their funds stuck if they get blacklisted while also being greenlisted

## Summary
Users who currently have the `GREENLISTED_ROLE` could also have the `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` at the same time, which would result in them being griefed their deposited funds to the protocol without receiving mTBILLs in return.

## Vulnerability Detail
Issuing mTBILLs on-chain is a two-step process (not counting the KYC and other off-chain processes). Users who want to receive mTBILLs would first deposit USD to the protocol, and then the admin with the role `M_TBILL_MINT_OPERATOR_ROLE` would mint the mTBILL ERC20 Tokens for the user.

However, at the moment, there's nothing hindering a user to be both greenlisted and blacklisted at the same time leading to the following scenario:

When the user deposits their funds, only their `GREENLISTED_ROLE` is validated in the function as seen in the code below: 
```solidity
   function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    { ... }
```
Only when the admin mints the mTBILLs (through the `mint()` function)  is the `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` checked, but at that time - the funds have already been sent to the contract. The user is unable to get it back (such as calling the `redeem()` function) due to already being blacklisted and thus unable to interact with the mTBILLs ERC20 token.

## Impact
As a result, the user will have lost their deposit without the means to get it back from the contract.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add the modifier `onlyNotBlacklisted` to the `deposit()` function that validates that the user is not blacklisted.
