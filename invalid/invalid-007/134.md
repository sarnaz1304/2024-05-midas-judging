# Conflicting Access Control: Greenlist and Blacklist

## Summary

The protocol has separate greenlist and blacklist mechanisms, leading to potential conflicts where a user can deposit tokens but cannot have tokens minted due to being on both lists, disrupting the protocol flow.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol employs two distinct access control lists:

- **Greenlist:** Allows users to interact with the vault, specifically to deposit USDC for mTBILL and redeem mTBILL for USDC.
- **Blacklist:** Restricts users from transferring mTBILL tokens.

These mechanisms operate independently, leading to a potential conflict where a user can be on both lists simultaneously. In such a case:

- The user can deposit USDC into the vault due to being on the greenlist.
- The admin cannot mint mTBILL tokens for the user because the user is on the blacklist, which prevents mTBILL token transfers.

This misalignment breaks the intended protocol flow and can cause significant operational issues. It is crucial to synchronize these access control mechanisms to ensure they work coherently.

## Code Snippet
User can be both on Greenlist and Blacklist (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/access/MidasAccessControl.sol#L34):

```jsx
    /**
     * @notice grant multiple roles to multiple users
     * in one transaction
     * @dev length`s of 2 arays should match
     * @param roles array of bytes32 roles
     * @param addresses array of user addresses
     */
    function grantRoleMult(bytes32[] memory roles, address[] memory addresses)
        external
    {
        require(roles.length == addresses.length, "MAC: mismatch arrays");
        address sender = msg.sender;

        for (uint256 i = 0; i < roles.length; i++) {
            _checkRole(getRoleAdmin(roles[i]), sender);
            _grantRole(roles[i], addresses[i]);
        }
    }
```

Being on Greenlist users can deposit tokens (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L91)

```jsx
function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
    external
    onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
    whenNotPaused
}
```

But as user is also on Blacklist, he/she cannot receive tokens, as the transfer hook prevents that (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mTBILL.sol#L98):

```jsx
function _beforeTokenTransfer(
    address from,
    address to,
    uint256 amount
)
    internal
    virtual
    override(ERC20PausableUpgradeable)
    onlyNotBlacklisted(from)
    onlyNotBlacklisted(to)
{
    ERC20PausableUpgradeable._beforeTokenTransfer(from, to, amount);
}
```

## Recommendation

Synchronize the greenlist and blacklist mechanisms to ensure coherent access control.
