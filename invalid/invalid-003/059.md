# No check if Arbitrum sequencer is down or not

## Summary
Absence of a check if Arbitrum sequencer is down or not
## Vulnerability Detail
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage(to deposit at the stale price if it is lower than the real one).
## Impact
If the Arbitrum sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to deposit at the previous (stale) rate.
