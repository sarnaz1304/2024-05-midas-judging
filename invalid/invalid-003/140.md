# _getDataInBase18() doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by unfreed users to gain an unfair advantage.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check:
_getDataInBase18

```solidity
function _getDataInBase18()
        private
        view
        returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer)
    {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
  @>    (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }
```

## Impact
could potentially be exploited by unfreed users to gain an **unfair** advantage to break the minAmountToDeposit Invariant and execute deposit.
