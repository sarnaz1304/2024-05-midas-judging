# No check if L2 Sequencer is active or down

## Summary
`_getDataInBase18` doesn't check Arbitrum l2 chainlink feed is active
## Vulnerability Detail
>On what chains are the smart contracts going to be deployed?

>The contracts will be deployed on Ethereum and Arbitrum.

When utilizing Chainlink in L2 chains like Arbitrum, it's important to ensure that the prices provided are not falsely perceived as fresh, even when the sequencer is down. This vulnerability could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

If the sequencer is down, messages cannot be transmitted from L1 to L2, and no L2 transactions are executed.


```solidity
function _getDataInBase18()
        private
        view
        returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer)
    {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }
```
## Impact

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function _getDataInBase18()
        private
        view
        returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer)
    {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }

## Tool used

Manual Review
If the Arbitrum sequencer goes down, the protocol will allow users to continue to operate at the previous (stale) rates.
## Recommendation
The recommendation is to implement a check for the sequencer in the L2 version of the contract, and a code example of Chainlink can be found at https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds#example-code.
