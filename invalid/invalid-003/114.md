# _getDataInBase18() doesn't check If Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds

## Summary
If you are using Chainlink Data Feeds on L2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Metis, you must also check the latest answer from the L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the data is accurate in the event of an L2 sequencer outage.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no check from sequencer as it must be in chainlink docs.

```solidity
 function _getDataInBase18() private view returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer) {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer,, uint256 updatedAt,) = aggregator.latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }
```

## Impact
could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.

'USING DATA FEEDS ON L2 NETWORKS

If you are using Chainlink Data Feeds on L2 networks like Arbitrum, Optimism, and Metis, you must also check the latest answer from the L2 Sequencer Uptime Feed to ensure that the data is accurate in the event of an L2 sequencer outage. See the [L2 Sequencer Uptime Feeds](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/l2-sequencer-feeds) page to learn how to use Data Feeds on L2 networks.'
