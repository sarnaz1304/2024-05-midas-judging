# No check if Arbitrum sequencer is down in Chainlink feeds.

## Summary
Because this protocol will be deployed on Arbitrum, so requires to check if the sequencer is down to avoid prices from looking like they are fresh although they are not.

The bug could be leveraged by malicious actors to take advantage of the sequencer downtime.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `DataFeed` is used the get the the price. There is no check that the sequencer is down:

```solidity
    function _getDataInBase18()
        private
        view
        returns (uint80 roundId, uint256 answer)
    {
        uint8 decimals = aggregator.decimals();
        (uint80 _roundId, int256 _answer, , uint256 updatedAt, ) = aggregator
            .latestRoundData();
        require(_answer > 0, "DF: feed is deprecated");
        require(
            // solhint-disable-next-line not-rely-on-time
            block.timestamp - updatedAt <= _HEALTHY_DIFF,
            "DF: feed is unhealthy"
        );
        roundId = _roundId;
        answer = uint256(_answer).convertToBase18(decimals);
    }
```

## Impact
could potentially be exploited by malicious actors to gain an unfair advantage.
