# Unused tokenOut Parameter in Redemption Function

## Summary

The `redeem()` function in the `RedemptionVault.sol` contract accepts a `tokenOut` parameter but does not use it for any token transfer operations. This could lead to a situation where users expect to receive a specific token upon redemption, but no such transfer occurs.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `redeem()` function is intended to facilitate the redemption of `mTBILL` tokens in exchange for a specified `tokenOut`. However, the current implementation does not include logic to handle the transfer of the t`okenOut` token to the user. Instead, the function only transfers `mTBILL` tokens from the user to the contract’s `tokensReceiver` without addressing the `tokenOut` parameter.

## Impact
Users calling the `redeem()` function may expect to receive a specific token (`tokenOut`) as a result of the redemption process. Since the `tokenOut` parameter is not utilized, the function fails to transfer the expected tokens to the user. This could lead to user dissatisfaction and potential loss of trust in the contract’s functionality, as the actual behavior does not match the expected outcome.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement logic to handle the `tokenOut` parameter properly. This involves converting the redeemed `mTBILL` tokens to the specified `tokenOut` token and transferring the corresponding amount to the user.
