# Users can increase their totalDeposited count without actually depositing any amount

## Summary
Users can increase their totalDeposited count as well as event emitted without actually depositing any amount

## Vulnerability Detail
For a user to record their deposit to the totalDeposited they have to transfer the fund through the `deposit()` function which calls   `_tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);`
however, in the _tokenTransferFromUser(), before executing the transfer it attempts to convert the amount to be transferred from base18 to the tokens decimal since it is expected that the amount should be in 10**18 decimals.
```solidity
function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            tokensReceiver,
  @>        amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token))
        );
    }
```
and the `convertFromBase18` basically divides the amount by the difference of 18 and the token decimal for cases where the decimal < 18:
```solidity
        if (originalDecimals > decidedDecimals) {
            adjustedAmount =
                originalAmount /
                (10**(originalDecimals - decidedDecimals));
```
This means if the amount to be transferred is still lesser than 10^(originalDecimals - decidedDecimals), it returns 0. The issue here is that, while this would still execute the transfer fine with 0 value, the amount account for the totalDeposited and event won't be the 0 amount but the initial amount specified as seen below
```solidity
 @>     totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
      _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

 @>     emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
```
notice it doesn't use the amount from result of the conversion but uses the initial amount specified `amountUsdIn` for the totalDeposited and event emission. 

Let's consider this scenario:
- A user iterate the deposit() call 
- passing an amount slightly lesser than the 10^(originalDecimals - decidedDecimals) i.e In the case of USDC: 9e11 ($0.0000009) 
- each slightly increasing their totalDeposited in a single transaction without actually depositing any amount.

## Impact
Majorly **accounting errors for the system** plus theft opportunity in small amounts as users can increase their totalDeposited count as well as event emitted without actually depositing any amount

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Simply check the amount returned from conversion != 0 before executing transfer. Here is the recommended fix:
```solidity
function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
            uint convertedAmount = amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token))
            if convertedAmount == 0 revert();
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            tokensReceiver,
            convertedAmount
        );
    }
```
