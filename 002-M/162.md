# `DepositVault::totalDeposited` increasing user totalDeposited value more than transferred token amounts

## Summary

`DepositVault::deposit()` is used to deposit USDC into the vault, in exchange for which users receive mTBILL tokens based on the deposited amount. However, there is a vulnerability where the `totalDeposited` state variable, which stores the user's deposited token amount, is updated with a higher value than the actual deposited amount. This results in the protocol issuing more mTBILL tokens than the value of the deposited USDC.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
File: midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol

 function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);//@audit check it reverts or retturn T/F

        lastRequestId.increment(); //lastRequest= lastRequest + 1
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
        require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;//@audit-issue add more than transferred amount
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    }
```
Exploit Path
1. Alice deposits USDC with `amountUsdIn = 199999999999999999` [ 17 nines ]
2. totalDeposited[Alice] becomes 199999999999999999
3.The internal function` _tokenTransferFromUser()` is called, converting the 18 decimal amount to 6 decimals, as USDC has 6 decimals
4. Conversion: `(199999999999999999 * 1e6) / 1e18 = 199999 USDC` tokens, which are then transferred to the contract
5. The emitted event shows the deposited amount as 199999999999999999.
6. But the actual transfer amount is 199999 USDC, in 18 decimal this will correspond to 1.99999 * 1e18 which is less than input amount
7. Since `totalDeposited[Alice]` and the emitted event are used to calculate the corresponding mTBILL amount, this results in more `mTBILL` tokens being issued than the actual transferred USDC value.

## Impact

Malicious users can exploit this flaw by making multiple such deposits, resulting in the protocol issuing more mTBILL tokens than the actual value of the deposited USDC.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update `totalDeposited[Alice]` with the actual transferred token amount instead of the input amount. Similarly, adjust the event emission to reflect the correct transferred amount
