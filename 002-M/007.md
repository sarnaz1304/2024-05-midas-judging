# Incorrect accounting for the totalDeposited mapping and incorrect event emission

## Summary
Incorrect accounting for the totalDeposited mapping and incorrect event emission
## Vulnerability Detail
Upon a user deposit, the `totalDeposited` mapping for his address gets set to the amount specified as a input parameter:
```solidity
totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn;
```
Then, we call `_tokenTransferFromUser()`:
```solidity
    function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            tokensReceiver,
            amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token))
        );
    }
```
The function transfers the tokens from the user to the `tokensReceiver`. However, the amount it uses will be completely different than the amount that the mapping was incremented with. If a user specifies 1e11 as the amount parameter and USDC as the token, the amount that will be transferred to the `tokensReceiver` will be 0 due to the calculations in `convertFromBase18()`. This allows users to not pay any money but still change the mapping. The event emission is also wrong and as confirmed by the sponsor, event emissions are very important off-chain.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Increment the mapping with the amount transferred or if you want to keep everything in 18 decimals, then convert the amount transferred into 18 decimals instead of using the input parameter.
