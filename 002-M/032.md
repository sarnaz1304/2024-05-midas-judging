# Using of Wrong Internal Function Leads to Wrong Accounting, Thus leading to mint wrong amount of mTBILL Tokens

## Summary

To give a context,  **DepositVault.sol**  is the entry point to the Midas Protocol, where users can deposit their USDC and get back their mTBILL Tokens(Though it's a separate contract where the Admin mints in a different transaction.)



## Vulnerability Detail

As **USDC** is the approved/whitelisted token for the project, it's important to note that it's a unique token which is having 6 decimals (unlike where other tokens generally have 18). 


When Investors/Users call the **deposit()** function with the USDC token & the amount, there's 100% chance that the protocol receives less than the entered amount but still the amount is added into the mapping **totalDeposited[User]** which can be clearly seen on-chain. 


Let's look into the code for better understanding: 

```solidity
 function deposit(address tokenIn, uint256 amountUsdIn)
        external
        onlyGreenlisted(msg.sender)
        whenNotPaused
    {
        address user = msg.sender;

        _requireTokenExists(tokenIn);

        lastRequestId.increment();
        uint256 requestId = lastRequestId.current();

        if (!isFreeFromMinDeposit[user]) {
            _validateAmountUsdIn(user, amountUsdIn);
        }
        require(amountUsdIn > 0, "DV: invalid amount");

        totalDeposited[user] += amountUsdIn; // @audit - USDC (6 Decimals): amountUsdIn: 100,000.000000
        _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);
    }
```

As you can see clearly, the state changes were made even before actually making interaction with the token contract. 

Assume, User called the "deposit(USDC, 100000000000)" with the respective parameters. (100000000000 is equal to 100,000 USDC as USDC is having 6 decimals).

This amount of 100,000 is added into the mapping even before calling **_tokenTransferFromUser**. 

While calling _tokenTransferFromUser(USDC, 100000000000) with the respective parameters, it makes an external-call to the "token" contract (in our USDC) with the following values as seen in the code:

```solidity
 function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal { // @audit - token: USDC, Amount: 100,000.000000
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            tokensReceiver,
            amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token)) // @audit - 100,000.000000 , 6
        );
    }
```

from: msg.sender
to: tokensReceiver(Midas)
amount: Calling Internal Function named "convertFromBase18" which converts 'originalAmount' with 18 decimals, into 6 decimals. 

```solidity
function convertFromBase18(uint256 originalAmount, uint256 decidedDecimals) // @audit - 100,000.000000 , 6
        internal
        pure
        returns (uint256)
    {
        return convert(originalAmount, 18, decidedDecimals);
    }

``` 

```solidity
 function convert(
        uint256 originalAmount,
        uint256 originalDecimals,
        uint256 decidedDecimals
    ) internal pure returns (uint256) {
        if (originalAmount == 0) return 0;
        if (originalDecimals == decidedDecimals) return originalAmount;

        uint256 adjustedAmount;

        if (originalDecimals > decidedDecimals) {
            adjustedAmount =
                originalAmount /
                (10**(originalDecimals - decidedDecimals));
        } else {
            adjustedAmount =
                originalAmount *
                (10**(decidedDecimals - originalDecimals));
        }

        return adjustedAmount;
    }
```

If you can see the **convert()** function, it takes the input parameters as following:
- originalAmount: 100000000000
- originalDecimals: 18
- decidedDecimals: 6 

As per the math, it simply does the following: 

adjustedAmount = 100000000000 / 10**(18-6)
                             = 100000000000 / 10**12
                             = 0.1 (Rounded down to Zero)

thus, the adjustedAmount will be 0.1 (And this will be the amount of tokens that will be transferred to the Midas Protocol, but 100,000 will be added into the mapping. 

Just a empty transfer with 0 tokens will be sent out. (Also resulting in loss-of-gas fee for the Midas protocol? Or to the User? - Not Sure)

## Impact

* With the wrong amount of tokens deposited into the Midas Protocol, still the event with the user-entered information is logged-out. This is a clear loss for the protocol. 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/DepositVault.sol#L111
```javascript
        emit Deposit(requestId, user, tokenIn, amountUsdIn);

```
 
Nevertheless, if still protocol mints the tokens by verifying the on-chain token transfers, it's completely the mistake of the protocol for not checking the correct math as user entered the right amount here.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation


Call the internal function "convertToBase18" to simply remove the issue. Along with that, always emit out a event log with the received values and not with the user-entered values.
