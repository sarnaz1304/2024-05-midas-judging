# Incorrect decimal handling leads to wrong amount of tokens transferred from the users while depositing and redeeming.

## Summary

Logic inside the ```convert``` function leads to incorrect amounts of tokens to be transferred when user calls ```redeem``` or ```deposit```.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's say user wants to deposit 100 USDC by ignoring the the minimum amount to deposit. USDC has 6 decimals on mainnet. 

```deposit(USDC, 100_000000)```

After all the checks, it leads to to call ``` _tokenTransferFromUser(tokenIn USDC, amountUsdIn 100_000000);```

```_tokenTransferFromUser``` is implemented in ManageableVault.sol:

```solidity
function _tokenTransferFromUser(address token, uint256 amount) internal {
        IERC20(token).safeTransferFrom(
            msg.sender,
            tokensReceiver,
            amount.convertFromBase18(_tokenDecimals(token))
        );
    } 
```

The amount to be included in the ``` safeTransferFrom``` is calculated by the ```convertFromBase18``` function.

```convertFromBase18```  is implemented in DecimalsCorrectionLibrary.sol.  
Continuing from the above flow, ```convertFromBase18 (100_000000, 6)``` is called which leads to ```convert(100_000000, 18, 6)```.  ```originalDecimals``` is 18, ```decidedDecimals``` is 6. 
In this case ``` if (originalDecimals > decidedDecimals)``` is true. 

So the ```adjustedAmount``` is calculated as: 100_000000/10**(18-6) => 100_000000/10**12 => 0.00001. 

```safeTransferFrom``` is called with the amount 0.00001. This means if user calls with the minimum amount to deposit value of 100 000 USDC, their wallet is only deducted by 1 cent.


## Impact
Protocol looses funds as a result of incorrect decimals handling in the function ```convert```.

## Recommendation

Inside the ```convert``` function do the changes below or call ```SafeTransferFrom``` without converting.
```solidity
  if (originalDecimals > decidedDecimals) {
            adjustedAmount =
-                  originalAmount /
+                 originalAmount *
                (10**(originalDecimals - decidedDecimals));
        } else {
            adjustedAmount =
-               originalAmount *
+              originalAmount /
                (10**(decidedDecimals - originalDecimals));
        }
```
