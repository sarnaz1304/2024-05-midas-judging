# Blacklist functionality of MTBill can be bypassed

## Summary
**MTBill** has a **Blacklistable** functionality that based on openzeppelin's **AccessControlUpgradeable**. 
Due to implementation and docs Blacklisted user should be assigned to **BLACKLISTED_ROLE** by **BLACKLIST_OPERATOR_ROLE**-admin, and should be removed by the admin as well. 
But this flow can be bypassed and user can remove himself from the blacklist.

## Vulnerability Detail
AccessControlUpgradeable brings an ability for any address with a role to renounce it's own role by using **renounceRole()**. Such behaviour will break completely Blacklist protection for **MTBill**.

1. Attacker account have been moved to Blacklist: **BLACKLISTED_ROLE** - granted by admin.
2. Attacker account execute **renounceRole(BLACKLISTED_ROLE, *himself*)**: **BLACKLISTED_ROLE** - revoked by attacker.
3. Attacker can continue to execute transactions with **MTBill**.

## Impact
Blacklist functionality can be bypassed by account that leads to broken protection of **MTBill** and enables transactions for restricted account.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function _onlyNotBlacklisted(address account)
        private
        view
        onlyNotRole(BLACKLISTED_ROLE, account)
    {}
```

```solidity
    function _onlyNotRole(bytes32 role, address account) internal view {
        require(!accessControl.hasRole(role, account), "WMAC: has role");
    }
```
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/access/MidasAccessControl.sol#L14-L17
```solidity
contract MidasAccessControl is
    AccessControlUpgradeable,
    MidasInitializable,
    MidasAccessControlRoles
```
https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v4.9.0/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L186-L190
```solidity
    function renounceRole(bytes32 role, address account) public virtual override {
        require(account == _msgSender(), "AccessControl: can only renounce roles for self");

        _revokeRole(role, account);
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Disable(at least for **BLACKLISTED_ROLE**) **renounceRole()** functionality by overriding it.
