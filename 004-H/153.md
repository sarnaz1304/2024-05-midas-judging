# `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` role can be renounced by anyone

## Summary
The user who has `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` can renounce this role and thus move himself/herself out of the blacklist

## Vulnerability Detail
The roles logic is handled via the `AccessControlUpgradeable` openzeppelin contract. This contract has public `renounceRole` function, which allows anyone to renounce their role. Admins can put user to blacklist to forbid the user to transfer tokens inside `mTBILL` contract. But the user can call `renounceRole` function on `MidasAccessControl` contract and thus remove the `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` role from himslef/herself. After that, the user can transfer `mTBILL` tokens again.

## Impact
Invalidates the protocol's black list logic

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Override `renounceRole`  function to make it not possible to call by users
