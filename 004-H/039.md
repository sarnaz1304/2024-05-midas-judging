# Any user can renounce `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` and bypass blacklist mechanism via `renounceRole`

## Summary

Any user can renounce `BLACKLISTED_ROLE` and bypass blacklist mechanism

## Vulnerability Detail

In OZ's implementation of `AccessControlUpgradeable.sol` [inherited by `MidasAccessControl`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/access/MidasAccessControl.sol#L15), there exists a functionality known as [`renounceRole()`](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts-upgradeable/blob/v4.9.0/contracts/access/AccessControlUpgradeable.sol#L186C14-L190), which allows user to revoke any role that it has been granted at any given point of time. 

This is especially dangerous for the `BLACKLISTED_ROLE`, where any users blacklisted by `BLACKLIST_OPERATOR_ROLE` can simply call `renounceRole()` to bypass the [`onlyNotBlacklisted()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2024-05-midas/blob/main/midas-contracts/contracts/mTBILL.sol#L98-L99) modifier within `_beforeTokenTransfer()`, allowing transfers of mTBILLS when not intended.

## Impact

Complete bypass of blacklist mechanism due to the ability to arbitrarily renounce role

## Recommendation

Override the `renounceRole()` function to revert when it is called
