# `DataFeed::_HEALTHY_DIFF` is very high than recommended

## Summary
`DataFeed::_HEALTHY_DIFF = 3 days` is very high than recommended by chainlink

## Vulnerability Detail
DataFeed is using `_HEALTHY_DIFF = 3 days` for checking `stale` price but this is very `high` as compared to what recommended by chainlink ie `1 day`, which means dataFeed can still `return` stale price because price can change within `1 day` period
```solidity
 uint256 private constant _HEALTHY_DIFF = 3 days;
```

## Impact
Stale price can be used
