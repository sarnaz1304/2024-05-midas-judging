# The Integration of Price Feed is not correct and vulnerable to stale price

## Summary
The Protocol assume that the IB01/USD price feed will not get updated at weekends  due to which they have used `3 days` timeout for stale price but in reality it is not, Due to this large timeout the Price feed is vulnerable to stale price conversion.

## Vulnerability Detail
Quoting this from Readme:
>Are the admins of the protocols your contracts integrate with (if any) TRUSTED or RESTRICTED? If these integrations are trusted, should auditors also assume they are always responsive, for example, are oracles trusted to provide non-stale information, or VRF providers to respond within a designated timeframe?

>IB01/USD Price from Chainlink is RESTRICTED, as their documentation states that the price will only be updated during defined market hours (weekends and holidays excluded), so we assume the price is only stale if more than three days have passed.

1. According to Chainlink docs the Oracle will update it price in following cases

|Name|Description|
|-----------|---------------|
|Deviation Threshold| Chainlink nodes are monitoring data offchain. The deviation of the real-world data beyond a certain interval triggers all the nodes to update.|
|Heartbeat Threshold|If the data values stay within the deviation parameters, it will only trigger an update every X minutes / hours.| 

Have look  [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/historical-data)
2. The Heart Beat for `IB01/USD` Price Feed is not `3 days` it is `86400s` .You can check it from [here](https://docs.chain.link/data-feeds/price-feeds/addresses?network=ethereum&page=1&search=IB01). 
From above two point it is clear that the Price Feed will update after every `86400s` , So `The Protocol assumes that it will not update from Friday to Sunday` which is wrong.
The ChainLink recommendation is that the Price may not be correct during off time of a market but they will update it after every `86400s`. the correct time to check for stale price is `86400s` not `3 days`.

For Proof that it also update the Price Feed during weekends. Pass `18446744073709551980` to `getRoundData` function of `AggregatorV3Interface` the time at which the Price Feed was update is `1716106835` in Unix time stamp and `Sun May 19 2024 08:20:35 GMT+0000` in GMT time zone. 

```solidity
    uint256 private constant _HEALTHY_DIFF = 3 days;
```
  
## Impact
This `_getDataInBase18()` will not revert if price is stale. which will result in wrong calculation for conversion.
