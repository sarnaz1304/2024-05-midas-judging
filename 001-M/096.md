# The heartbeat interval is too large, leading to the use of stale prices

## Summary
ChainlinkAdaptor uses constant 3 day heartbeat  when checking if the data feed is fresh.
This is not a reasonable time interval, as prices can update within hours. A too large interval may result in the contract obtaining stale prices.

According to the Chainlink documentation and contract, the EUR-USD price can be updated within hours. However, the protocol currently uses a constant interval of 3 days to check for stale prices. This interval is clearly not reasonable and should be adjusted to hours.
