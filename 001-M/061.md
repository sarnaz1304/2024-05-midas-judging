## Impact
Users  will deposit funds at stale price rate, which is a big problem for big deposits like the minimum starting deposit (100000 euro)

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
As the `EUR/USD` price feed have different heartbeats on Arbitrum and on Eth Mainnet, make `_HEALTHY_DIFF` and immutable variable and set it in the `initialize` function as close to the heartbeat as possible(24 hours for Mainnet, 1 hour for Arbitrum)
