# Independent Pause Functionality Issue in Vault Contracts

## Summary

The `DepositVault.sol` and `RedemptionVault.sol` contracts inherit from a common `Pausable.sol` contract, which allows pausing and unpausing of operations. Although these contracts are designed to have distinct admin roles (`DEPOSIT_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` and `REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`), the current implementation of the pause functionality does not allow for independent pausing and unpausing of the `DepositVault` and `RedemptionVault` contracts. This issue could lead to situations where pausing one vault inadvertently affects the other, and vice versa, despite the intended role-based separation.

## Vulnerability Detail

Both `DepositVault` and `RedemptionVault` inherit from the `Pausable` contract, which includes the `pause` and `unpause` functions:
```solidity
abstract contract Pausable is WithMidasAccessControl, PausableUpgradeable {
    modifier onlyPauseAdmin() {
        _onlyRole(pauseAdminRole(), msg.sender);
        _;
    }

    function pause() external onlyPauseAdmin {
        _pause();
    }

    function unpause() external onlyPauseAdmin {
        _unpause();
    }

    function pauseAdminRole() public view virtual returns (bytes32);
}
```
Each vault overrides the `pauseAdminRole()` to return its specific admin role:
```solidity
contract DepositVault is ManageableVault, IDepositVault {
    function pauseAdminRole() public pure override returns (bytes32) {
        return DEPOSIT_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE;
    }
}

contract RedemptionVault is ManageableVault, IRedemptionVault {
    function pauseAdminRole() public pure override returns (bytes32) {
        return REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE;
    }
}
```
The issue arises because the `pause` and `unpause` functions set a global paused state that affects the entire contract. f the `DEPOSIT_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` pauses the `DepositVault`, it will also pause any functionality in the `RedemptionVault` that is protected by the `whenNotPaused` modifier. Similarly, if the `REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE` unpauses the `RedemptionVault`, it will unpause the `DepositVault` as well.

## Impact

If there is an issue and the deposit role owner pauses the deposits, the redeem function will also be paused. However, if the project decides to unpause the redeem function so users can redeem, calling unpause by the redeem role owner will unpause the whole protocol. This lack of granularity in the pause functionality could lead to security risks and operational inefficiencies.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement separate pause flags and modifiers, so the `DepositVault` and `RedemptionVault` can be paused and unpaused independently, ensuring that issues in one vault do not affect the operations of the other.
