# REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE and  DEPOSIT_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE allows Pausing and Unpausing of `DepositVault` and `RedemptionVault` Contract

## Summary
The ManageableVault contract allows the admin with the vaultRole to pause and unpause the contract. The pausing and unpausing of  the vaults contract was not part of roles stated to be trusted with the vault admins (REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE and  DEPOSIT_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE) in contest README as all roles trusted with various admins was explicitly stated and all other roles not stated are assumed restricted

## Vulnerability Detail
The ManageableVault contract inherits from the Pausable contract, which provides the pause and unpause functions. The pauseAdminRole function returns the vaultRole, which means that any admin with the vaultRole can pause and unpause the `DepositVault` and `RedemptionVault` Contract

## Impact
REDEMPTION_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE and  DEPOSIT_VAULT_ADMIN_ROLE admin can prevent deposit and redeem functionalities because they carry the  whenNotPaused modifier

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To ensure that the admin does not have the ability to pause and unpause the contract, modify the pauseAdminRole function to return a different role that is specifically designated for pausing and unpausing the contract.
