# Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

## Title
Corruptible Upgradability Pattern

## Summary
 
MidasAccessControl Store could be corrupted when is upgraded


## Vulnerability Detail

MidasAccessControl main purpose is to provide support to Midas protocol for roles handling and utility methods: `setup`, `grantRoleMult` and `revokeRoleMult`. Also it is an upgradable contract in order to add new functionality or fix bugs but in the case of an upgrade the storage layout will be corrupted because there is no gap slot defined neither in MidasAccessControl or parents, as the inheritance chart for MidasAccessControl.sol shows:

**GREEN**: Does have gaps but all of them are from the openzeppelin library

**YELLOW**: Does not have gaps, all of them are from Midas protocol.

### Store gaps analysis

| Contract | Has Gap | Store gap |
|----------|----------|----------|
| DepositVault | YES | 50 |
| RedemptionVault | YES | 51 |
| mTBILL | YES | 50 |
| MidasAccessControl | `NO` | - |

MidasAccessControl is the only important contract that doesn't have gaps as we can see in the table:


## Impact

Storage of MidasAccessControl might be corrupted during upgrading and causing the role system to be broken and whole protocol unstable.

## Recommendation

Define an appropriate storage gap in MidasAccessControl as follows:

```javascript
    /**
     * @dev leaving a storage gap for futures updates
     */
uint256[50] __gap; 
```

Also a store gap could be added in parent contracts of MidasAccessControl  but i don't see that necessary.
